3 stars, "Excelente concepto", by Daniel Chávez, for version 1.8, on 07-Jul-2012
Opentable es un muy buen concepto y excelente idea para hacer reservaciones desde un móvil sin tener que tomar el teléfono y tomarse la molestia. Sin embargo carece de variedad; hay muchos restaurantes que no se pueden encontrar en la aplicación y si se pudiere sería aun más efectiva.

4 stars, "Very clean, easy to use", by V66jack, for version 1.0, on 25-Jun-2010
The practicality on this app is great, picked it up and instantly knew how to use it. The location search works very well but there is room for improvement. For example more pictures, more reviews, clearer pricing information and so on. But overall very good! :)

1 star, "Not impressed", by Semiferalerol, for version 1.0, on 29-Aug-2010
Didn't like finding a restaurant through google search, being told 'nice iPad... Download the app' only to find the restaurant wasn't there. Selection of restaurants in London is weak... Good services should be about hidden gems, not the same stuff the appears as standard everywhere. May be ok of you're new to an area but I'm uninstalling this!

4 stars, "Good app poor uk coverage", by Steven Powley, for version 1.3, on 12-May-2011
Hard to fault the app itself. It is quick, clear and simple to navigate and filter to suit your needs. Changing dates, party size, restaurant type, typical costs etc. with ease. 

Disappointing only in regards to so many great restaurants not listed. I appreciate that I live quite remote, but it located about half a dozen restaurants within a 20 mile radius whereas I could list probably 50 without too much of a stretch. It does look like major cities and the US has a much greater uptake. 

In summary, live in the US or a major city elsewhere then go for it.

3 stars, "Mostly brilliant!", by Star1412, for version 1.3.1, on 26-Jun-2011
I have found this app amazing! It got me a fantastic table for 8 people 2 hours before a take that concert in Cardiff, when everywhere seemed to be full. Very quick, instant. Love it! My only gripes are that I can't seem to write a review, and it also still keeps listing loads of restaurants in america where I first used it. I don't seem to be able to update my profile so that it defaults to local places rather than America.

I love being able to make quick and simple bookings with this app. Never any issue with booking itself, always there waiting for me. 

Some of the flow is a fiddle. The groupings of places is a little odd, but overall gets the job done. 

Keep adding more restaurants.

I had this app on my iPhone and it was great, found local restaurants and was easy to book tables. Now it can't even find a local pub, that I've booked before, when I search for the name.  Shame really as this was a good app, hopefully they'll fix it soon.

5 stars, "Dinning with ease", by P&JT, for version 1.8.1, on 21-Aug-2012
This is the first app review I have written despite being an iPad nut. This app is so easy to you when you wanting to make bookings at good restaurants. Excellent selections of restaurants just wish there were more in London. We use it each year when we are on holiday in Miami. It is so convenient. We can book last Knute into great restaurants or confirm bookings for several whilst we on holiday always with no hassle. Would recommend this as a must for any foodie in the US. Doesn't really work that well in the UK but that's more a function of the London market.

2 stars, "OK but...", by RichBoston, for version 1.0, on Jun 16, 2010

1 star, "Fatal flaws ruin an otherwise great app!", by dgp1, for version 1.3.1, on Jun 21, 2011
Problem #1 (showstopper): can't make a reservation at a place that requires you to give a credit card to hold your reservation. It unhelpfully tells you "the credit card information appears to be incorrect." Well there is no way to enter a credit card! This app will be useless to me until they fix this bug. I emailed support and they wrote back saying that was the first they heard of it. The minute this is fixed and I find out about it, this review will be updated and 3 stars will be added on, for a new rating of at least 4 stars.

#2: it doesn't return you to where you left off when you switch away from the app. You have to start over. Fix this for one more star.

1 star, "Terrible terrible", by Iphonecommander123, for version 1.1, on Dec 8, 2010
Terrible app.  No time suggestions.  Once you choose a day, you need to re-find the restaurant to choose a different day.   Terrible experience overall compared to web site.

5 stars, "Great for travel", by Seminarian, for version 1.2, on Jan 18, 2011
I just love this when I am traveling.  In a recent trip I used it in New York, Las Vegas and San Francisco to book restaurants, often with only 15 minutes notice.  

The map is so useful to know where the restaurant is.  I first look at what is close, then filter down by food types.

1 star, "Why bother", by Mary.Fred, for version 1.3.1, on Jun 8, 2011
The review section is a joke. No one gets fewer than 4 stars!
Obviously they screen out any negatives--making the app useless. It's easy to find a place to eat just anything. I want some advice on how to skip the bad ones.

2 stars, "Good product, bad app", by Nyipaduser, for version 1.7, on Mar 1, 2012
Crashes very often. When you come out of the app to check something else in iPad (restaurant reviews etc) you return to the main menu page again. It does'nt pick up your last search results.That is the HUGE pain.

1 star, "Needs More Work", by OriginalSactobob, for version 1.0, on Jun 19, 2010
As far as it goes, it's nice. BUT..... I want to "see" the restaurant and its menu before making a reservation. Hey, guys, most restaurants have a web presence, so add the ability to connect.  IMHO, that just might make this a killer app!

2 stars, "Should be better", by Consultgp, for version 1.1, on Nov 29, 2010
So few cities represented.  I live in South Florida and when it cant even show you a restaurant in Napples you know its a fork short of a set.  I guess if you live in NY it might be OK but in my view just use a search engine as thats better than this.
--
1 star, "Can't search by name", by Turkeymonkey, for version 1.0, on Jun 24, 2010
Tried searching a dozen or so restaurants by name, and every time the app showed zero results. This was even the case with restaurants that showed up when using the locate me functionality. The inability to search restaurants by name makes this app practically useless to me.

4 stars, "Worked fine, good app, needs more to be complete", by Pretorian435, for version 1.0, on Sep 6, 2010
Used the app this evening and it worked wonderfully. The information provided was excellent, and it was easy to schedule my reservation. I wasn't able to provide a review from the app, however, and had to go to the website. Hopefully this will show up in a future update.  Of note you are also not able to view your profile, and I had to go back to the website to update that as well. Like others I found it curious that the app did not offer all the functionality of the website.
--
5 stars, "Better than the website", by bszweda, for version 1.0, on Oct 2, 2010
This app maximizes the screen space excellently and pulls in many ipad features like maps and GPS. It's a layout a lot like the new Twitter allowing for side by side viewing. You can view more on one screen here than you can on the actual website. My favorite thing is that when you click on a place to view its details the search page does not go away requiring you to start your search all over again.

3 stars, "Open Table good not great", by tfcnydiner, for version 1.3.1, on May 28, 2011
Crashes frequently, so you're always starting a new search. It doesn't remember your previous searches.  The iPad feature of showing available restaurants for the center portion of the displayed map is a good idea but an improvement would be to outline the area it will cover as it's hard to predict the area by eye alone!  

There are still odd limitations on search features. Why can't you search on multiple categories? So instead of only being able to filter by one price category at once why not "$$$ and up" for example? Or why not search for multiple cuisines at once? Like French and Italian rather than needing to filter several times?  Wouldn't this be simple to code? Seem like strange omissions!

The range of restaurants covered is great. I think we'd all find the app far better if a few simple things (and the irritating crashing) were sorted out pronto!

1 star, "Many bugs", by nargan, for version 1.3.1, on Jun 16, 2011
1. "find by name" button often and reliably causes the app to crash

2. Once you're viewing a restaurant for a particular date and time, there is no way to choose a different date (say, because the restaurant only has openings at 10pm)

3. Filter system requires tapping done too many times
--
1 star, "Terrible usability.", by Deviller, for version 1.5, on Oct 21, 2011
God forbid you make any mistake inputting the date, time or party size you are trying to book for because this app has to be restarted to erase your mistake. Brilliant. No one thought about a back button during the design meetings?

1 star, "Not multitasking friendly", by mnipader, for version 1.5, on Oct 23, 2011

I've used Open Table extensively over several years. I've found it to be unerringly accurate, timely, and always connecting me to the right table at the right restaurant and at the right time! There is never a conflict, or dispute, or issue concerning my priority reservations. I will continue using it without fail...

2 stars, "Very frustrating", by Alex Ranous, for version 1.7.1, on May 15, 2012
This app has a fatal flaw in my book.  If you switch to an other app for any reason, the app forgets all of its state and you start over.  God forbid you need to check your email or perhaps check a restaurant review.  I'm now sticking to their web interface until they learn Apple's multitasking API.

Fix the bugs and also think it through, guys.  

Why don't you allow for personal registration through the app?  Why should I have to pull out my laptop to set things up?  

Also, it doesn't allow me to change the default reservation time.  Fail.

Seriously, what was the rush?  Did the developer even try the app before pushing it out the door?

The iPhone version is/remains much better.

5 stars, "Better than calling for reservations", by HGH, for version 1.0, on Jul 3, 2010
I use this application on both the iPhone and the iPad and I absolutely love it. Admittedly, the app is easier to use on the iPad given the larger screen. One thing I have noticed... it's better to use the app to make a reservation than it is to call. It seems to me restaurants are attempting to persuade patrons to make reservations using Open Table. There have been several occasions where I have called the restaurant to make a reservation at a given time and the person with whom I spoke told me nothing was available for the time I requested. When I used this application to make a reservation at the same restaurant on the same day for my desired time I was able to get what I wanted. Also, it's just easier and faster making a reservation for a given restaurant using this application than it is to call and possibly be put on hold, etc. One other thing... a very nice feature of this application is it allows you to view all the restaurants in a given area, thereby not only giving you an idea of what's around the given area but also giving you ideas you may not otherwise have had. Sometimes it's nice just to use the application to view all the restaurants in a given area and decide from there what you'd like to eat. Get this app. It works great and it's free.

1 star, "Crashes on start", by iphonemike09, for version 1.0, on Jul 5, 2010
The app crashes right away after launching. I don't get past the splash screen. Within a second I am back at spring board. I even restarted the device entirely to make sure that it is not a memory issue. 

Would love to see the app work.

2 stars, "Badly designed app", by whabib, for version 1.0, on Jul 18, 2010
This is truly a case where the website is dramatically better designed than the app.  The whole point of apps should be to make an interface that escapes the limitations of the website and in this case it should allow for a far more dynamic searching environment. Instead, you have a search interface that is constrained and clunky to use. Further, there is tons of wasted space on the screens.  This review applies equally to the iPhone as well as the ipad app, although the deficiencies are especially galling in an iPad app.

2 stars, "Could be so much better", by Mmaammbboo, for version 1.0, on Jul 21, 2010
The app is quite nice but I find it very limited.

- Favourites for Areas, Type of Restaurants and Type of Food
- ability to freely choose number of seats and arrival times
- ical connectivity, possibility to forward invites with calendar attachment, navigational help
- first and foremost, why arent germany, france and all the other countries where opentable is represented available with this app and why is my opentable account not accepted in all the other opentable sites.. This is a braindead nuisance for someone traveling around...

For a free app, it's perfect for me. Here on the west coast, there are plenty of places to choose from. Although I have to agree with other reviews about a lack of choices in other areas. Not a whole lot on the east coast except for NY and D.C.

Other than that, the features are great and I'll be sure to use this app whenever I plan on dining out.

Great app if you don't need to change a reservation.  When you have an existing reservation and want to cancel or change it well in advance, I get an error message telling me that I can't cancel a past reservation.  Problem is that the app thinks that my p.m. reservation is an a.m. reservation even though the reservation is clearly p.m..

I love Open Table but unfortunately this latest version doesn't work, crashes every time I try to use the map or find a table after typing the restaurant name manually. The same happens with the iPhone version, they are unusable until a fixed version is released. Please update!!

Good grief - this iPad app needs work. Will not select restaurant from drop down. Have to type entire name in field. Enter phone number and special request - asks for phone number again. Please do some testing on this app and fix it. It works better on iPhone but best on laptop. Forget it for now on iPad. takes to long. Easier to call restaurant.

1 star, "Appears to be epic FAIL", by CritiCat, for version 1.2, on Jan 24, 2011
Upon first opening, the app asked to use my current location.  The result was a persistent error window stating the "metro list" could not be opened and to "try again later" then a response tap box "ok", but it loops forever and I had to terminate the app from the running app dock.

I'm deleting the app, since it cannot be used with my iPad with iOS4.2

2 stars, "Crashes and Needs lots of work", by L in Chicago, for version 1.2, on Feb 4, 2011
This app needs to work, because the website is too small and cramped to use on the Ipad/Iphone, but it doesn't.

It crashes too often, especially when searching by name.

Plus, select a restaurant by name.  Now pick a day/time to find a reservation.  Don't like the times available?  No problem, just start over with a different day/time.... OH WAIT!  YOU'CANT!!  If you try to pick a new day/time, it won't let you stay with the same restaurant, it starts a whole new search across all restaurants.  Idiotic.

OpenTable needs to understand something: we're not slaves to food.  We don't have to get a reservation for 7pm tonight no matter where we have to eat.  SOMETIMES, we actually want to go to A PARTICULAR RESTAURANT.  Make it so I can find the next convenient reservation at that restaurant, if it's not today, tomorrow.  If not tomorrow, Sunday.  Whatever.  But if I said I want THIS restaurant, keep me there until I tell you otherwise.  I'm sick of trying to start the process from scratch because there are no openings at my restaurant tonight.

This app is so frustrating and irritating, it is easier to put down the iPad and go to the computer to use Opentable.com.  That's just what you want in an app, right?

3 stars, "Good, but oddly miss basic features", by jweinberger, for version 1.2, on Apr 19, 2011
Nice app with good use of the iPad UI, but some key features, which are included in the iPhone app, are missing, and there's a really big miss of the iPad.

- when you switch to another app, this app does not suspend as all other iPad apps do (or should!).

This is especially obnoxious when you are looking at alternate times and want to check your calendar to be sure you're open. If you go to calendar, you have to restart OpenTable all over again at the beginning of the reservation.

- cannot remember me from session to session.

Unclear why I need to sign in every time. I don't on the iPhone app. Maybe a lazy developer?

- can't get my account information from their server even when logged in

It does not auto fill my phone number - I have to enter it every time I make a reservation. Again, unclear why, maybe a lazy developer again. Also it does not accept standard phone number formats, allowing digits only. We're beyond the age of ASCII, right?

- there's no feedback. Or I would have sent this rant directly OpenTable before posting it here.

It's a decent app that does what it needs, but is unnecessarily annoying and lacks essential features. Hoping they'll figure out how to get it right soon...

2 stars, "Needs more features.", by stvn641, for version 1.3, on May 3, 2011
Such as the ability to browse restaurants. When the app opens, you select your location and provide the desired date and time for your reservation. The app pulls up a list of all open reservations at the time you listed and you select one of these reservations.

I'd much rather browse through restaurants with the ability to sort by top rated, style, price, neighborhood etc. and after I decide what restaurant I want to eat at, figure out the time based on what's available.

If you absolutely must have a reservation at a certain time on a certain day, then this app would be good for you. I suspect, however, that most people are somewhat flexible in terms of time and make their reservation based on the restaurant instead of a specific time. For doing that, this app is absolutely useless.
--
1 star, "Frustrating and needs a lot of work to improve", by Ravenpuff, for version 1.3, on May 7, 2011
Besides not being synched to the restaurant, which I'll go into later, when I was trying to find a reservation, it said that no reservations were available with 2.5 hours of my desired time.  So I tried to pick a different date, but this app wouldn't let me pick a different date without relaunching with a new search.  And sometimes that did not reset my search date parameters.  Then one time, of the many searches for a seating for a table of 5, I forgot to click 5 and I was stuck with a table for 2.  Trying to reset that was impossible until I killed the app entirely and relaunched.

This app need to have the ability to choose a different date if a particular restaurant is not available for a seating for a night.

In addition, I got so frustrated having to maneuver with this app, I gave up and called the restaurant directly and got a table for 5 on the night I was told nothing available for 2.5 hours, and right at the time I requested.  So either the restaurant is not synched in with Open Table or this app stinks.  The on,y reason I can give this app one star is the fact it was free to install.  If I had to fork over money for this app, I would withhold all stars.

Hey developers/coders for Open Table, rework this app if you want  people to use this on the iPad.  Until there is a major upgrade, I'll avoid using this app.

2 stars, "Great service - challenged app", by glev1, for version 1.3, on May 10, 2011
I use open table frequently and love the service. But the app is not nearly as easy to use as the web site. The app does not remember your search if you leave the app. Any change you make requires you to start a new search. It is very frustrating and until the interface matches the ease of us on the website, i will continue with the website. 

Te mapping features are very helpful, but the above issues make the app too frustrating to use. I hope it is fixed as it could be a truly useful app.

4 stars, "ATTENTION MILWAUKEE USERS", by Mchium, for version 1.3, on May 11, 2011
If you are searching for a restaurant by name and using "current location" or " Milwaukee, WI, USA" it will not work.  That is because the app currently thinks we all live in Chicago.

If you change your location to "Wisconsin, USA" your search will work fine.

4 stars for the great, responsive customer support to help figure this out.  They will be working on this fix now that they know about the issue.

Will give 5 stars once they successfully move us back to Milwaukee!

2 stars, "Ok, but let me scroll!!!", by Thomas Mski, for version 1.3.1, on Jun 4, 2011
Not bad, but why can I only scroll thru 20 or so restaurants at a time? The iphone app lets you scroll thru entire list without pressing up or down buttons. Just makes it slow and clumsy. Pressing the up or down arrow buttons opens more restaurants that fit in the window as well... Some usability issues but good app other than that.

1 star, "Not very useful", by Dave The hungry, for version 1.3, on Jun 15, 2011
I don't know whether the problem is OpenTable itself, or this iPad app, but it doesn't seem to do much of anything. After dining at an old favorite last evening, and having a decidedly mediocre experience, I wanted to warn others. I tried several times to find my restaurant by name, only to be told it was not in the database, after entering the first few letters of the name. Of course, it is in the database, a fact I only discovered after laboriously paging to the correct page in the alphabetical list. But once found, the only choice seems to be to make a reservation for tonight. No ability I could find to change the date, no way to enter my own review.

Attempted to make a reservation to a restaurant that is listed under opentable.com. I like to test apps before I rely on them. Not only did the app not list the restaurant it gave me one several states away when i tried re-searching the correct restaurant the app crashed. Even as a free app this is laughable.  While I was calling the restaurant to book my reservation I deleted this app. Dont waste your time not only is it innacurate it is unreliable.

Buggy.  If you leave the app (i checked the name of a restaurant in an email), it loses your search criteria and you need to start over.  When i was in a search and tapped 'map' to go back and view the location, it had zoomed me way out so that the entire U.S. was showing.   Seems like an early, buggy app.

It should be so much better on the iPad but it is missing functions. they have somehow made it hard to use. #1 feature I want is to be able to search only my favorite restaurant list! The only reason I can think of as to why they excluded this is to make money from the crappy restaurants that come up when you search everything the area.

If you know exactly what reservation you want and can go directly to the restaurant and time to see if it's available, then the app is fine. If, however, you are thinking of browsing different restaurants, neighborhoods, and availabilities, then forget it. The app crashes all the time, so you'll quickly tire of restarting it and reentering all your search criteria to get back to where you were.

At this point if an application doesn't support multi-tasking on iOS you have to wonder if it's even supported anymore. OpenTable has sadly made very few enhancements to their application since it was originally released for the iPhone. It took them ages to update the application to support the iPad and one would think updating the app to remember it's state upon closing would be a no-brained, and yet we're left with an unstable app that crashes all the time and forces the user to start their search from the very beginning if they dare to switch to another app. Perhaps it's time for this company to take action and actually update their application for their large and loyal user base.

4 stars, "Great, but missing something", by tulip's tunes, for version 1.6, on Feb 23, 2012
The app is extremely helpful. So far it has steered us towards good eats. One thing I find aggravating is the lack of N indicating the total number of reviews for a restaurant. It's one thing to be a customer rated 5-star experience, it's misleading when only 1 person reviewed. I would be more inclined to trust the ranking if I knew the numbers behind them.

Limited functionality vs the actual website.  Difficult to get back to your original search and most of the time you cannot and are forced to start all over.  Sigh.  Useful for when you know exactly what you are looking for.  Cannot check or redeem points via this app.  I was surprised about that.  I hope that is something they will add in future updates.

Nice atmosphere and tasty food. Their burgers are delicious. They also have very good personal size gourmet pizza. Plus many other casual American food options. It can be a little loud, but there are TVs with games on and a big bar area on one side of the restaurant. They sometimes have musical entertainment too. Overall a nice neighborhood place next to the big AMC theater.

5 stars, "Absolute timesaver", by ForensicCPA, for version 1.6, on Feb 26, 2012
Open Table does something few other apps can pull off: make life a little less stressful. I travel frequently and typically use Open Table for dinner reservations wherever I am, including the hotel restaurant. And most of my reservations are made while I'm doing something else. Never a misspelling, directions are available and some menus too. My only "reservation:" it is sometimes frustrating to find no availability through Open Table but plenty of tables with a direct call. I appreciate that restaurants will only allocate a limited number of seats to a program that costs them money, but ...

3 stars, "Poorly designed", by snavedog, for version 1.6, on Feb 28, 2012
This app is functional, but only because it is used by so many restaurants.  The app itself is poorly designed.  It defaults to listing every restaurant in your location.   I live in San Francisco, so that's a lot!   You wait while it loads that data, then you use "filter" to select cuisine and neighborhood. It then offers you two "done" buttons.  Choose wisely.  If you make any mistake or have to leave the app for any reason, it returns to the default of everything.  It would be much better if you could set your specific search parameters first. 

I use the app because I eat out a lot, but I sure wish there was a better option out there.

4 stars, "Good basic app", by MizPamplemousse, for version 1.6, on Mar 1, 2012
Seems to be a few negative reviewers here based on weak complaints- the facts are that this is a simple, fairly stable app that provides real value. It's far more functional than the $10 competitor. I would happily pay more for this one. 
Open Table has been my go-to app for dinner reservations for a few years. 99% of restaurant searches are successful, and the reservation tool is great- works every time. I highly recommend it.

5 stars, "Very Helpful! A++", by foolishbride, for version 1.6, on Mar 4, 2012
I've been using this app for about a year and love it. We were new to our area and used OT to suggest restaurants near us. Using it, we saw reviews from other diners, saw the actual menus, called up directions etc. A good way to get to know the local offerings. We also traveled to other areas in the US and found the app useful there, too. When you open the app up, you can search by desired time to see which member restaurants have availability, book the table for your party size, get an email confirmation immediately--all fast and convenient. Plus, the Special Requests option has always provided us with a nice seat (quiet booth, view etc)--whatever we requested. And, after the dining experience, we can review the restaurant ourselves. Only reviews from real customers here. Plus, I just received my first Dining Check after cashing in 2K dining points. Now we get $20 off our next meal at any OT restaurant. Pretty cool.

5 stars, "OpenTable Changes Everything", by Joe Rando, for version 1.7, on Mar 4, 2012
I rarely go to restaurants that aren't on OpenTable. Why pick up the phone and call to see if there's a table when you can just know immediately with no work?  If you own a restaurant, put it in OpenTable.  If you eat at restaurants, get this app.

5 stars, "Perfect app - use it every week", by Tomkatt, for version 1.7, on Mar 5, 2012
Will rarely eat anywhere that is not on Open Table. They have made it simple to find a table and then make changes if your plans do. The points you earn can be turned into dollars that can be used at open table restaurants so it is not only easy but pays off in the end with real rewards. Why wouldn't you use it? I can't think of a single reason. Great app.

Intuitive, efficient, and convenient.  There is no longer any reason to wait on phone hold with a restaurant.  Open table provides immediate gratification and allows for better organization as the reservation is easily added to your calendar.  In addition, instant access to a map is helpful and the option to write a note to the restaurant about allergies or time constraints is very useful!

Use OT all the time. Saved my arssss a few times. But have also made a reservation (twice at the same place actually) and arrived to be told they were closed. We are late eaters so Open Table makes it easy to find a good restaurant - or - it is orange county - a restaurant that is open past 10pm.

3 stars, "Open Table", by Hailing Queen, for version 1.7, on Mar 12, 2012
Works well. Helps to even get a last minute reservation - while we were standing in the restaurant and they told us there would be an hour wait but I booked a reservation to be seated in 15 minutes. Can't beat that. Just wish try could connect the ratings to something substantial like Zagat and also would populate restaurants in the search results when there isn't anything within 1.5 hours of the requested time. Too often too many of the results are accompanied by the note "no availability within 2 hours" which is a waste to include those (non) options in the output / search results.

Open Table is a superior app that is a great convenience for making reservations at known restaurants locally, and you can make them at all hours of the day or night, not just during business hours. Also, it is a great tool when traveling for educating you about the food, location, menu, price range and for the making of reservations.  Can be a real time saver.
--
2 stars, "Massee", by Scotlandscone, for version 1.7, on Mar 13, 2012

You can beat how accessible it is for any location if you travel as it covers ever major city, town or metro are!

Best of all, you get points towards gift certificates you can use towards dining at any restaurant that participates in Open Table! Don't leave home without it!

The use of space is terrible when trying to find a restaurant to dine. The map takes up more than 50% of my iPad while vital info is unceremoniously and lazily formatted on the side. This view should be a hidden option. Only to be called up when desired. Photos of food and restaurant should be large so users can quickly narrow down long lists of choices. 

Opentable is a great idea and I will continue using the service but sadly I won't be using this app. Am promptly deleting it.

Great app when doing some surfing at home or a hotel.  Wish there was a way to select more options (for example, $$ and $$$ instead of just $$) and to see combined yelp, open table and google ratings.  It would also be handy to search by proximity so you can research on the fly as you are walking or driving.  Of course you are dependent on the restaurants that show up on the list, but on the whole it's a decent variety.

3 stars, "App works, but needs polish", by Balaji S., for version 1.7, on Mar 31, 2012
This review is regarding the OpenTable app, not the service itself (which is fine). While it is pretty straightforward to use the iPad app to book a table at a restaurant, there a number of minor shortcomings that when combined make the app rather frustrating to use:

1) The app exits completely when you return to the home screen or switch to another app, meaning if you jump to Calendar to check your schedule before selecting a date, your search is reset when you return to the OpenTable app and you have to start over. App switching has been supported since iOS 4, so there's no excuse for this app not to support it.

2) Once you've selected your desired date and time, there's no clear way to search for a different date or time for the same restaurant if your preference wasn't available; instead, you once again have to start from the restaurant search.

3) It seems like in general your inputs are not remembered. For instance, if you enter your phone number in the reservation sheet then tap on the Special Request button, hitting Cancel will take you back to the reservation sheet but will lose your input.

These all seem like fairly minor issues that if fixed would make this app much easier to use.

5 stars, "Best, most complete restaurant reservations", by TahoeFlyer, for version 1.7, on Apr 3, 2012
Open Table is used by a very high percentage of mid to high end restaurants, making it very easy to find a restaurant that meets your requirements and timing. Some lower tier restaurants also use Open Table. It's incredibly valuable for business meals and date nights. You can make reservations in the future or spontaneously for near-immediate meals. It's great when you are in a restaurant-heavy area, hungry, and don't want to call or walk into multiple places to see who might have a table available. 

Open Table and Yelp are two of my most used applications. The reviews are useful and the map connections are very helpful. I like that Open Table keeps track of reservations and I can go back to check if I have forgotten. It is also incredibly easy to modify reservations if you are running late or otherwise need to change. There is room for special requests as well. 

Only one improvement - before I retired my life was choreographed on Exchange - it would be great to have automatic calendar updating to the iPhone calendar (and then to whatever sync you have)

4 stars, "Very helpful and trusty", by Robert Kinsey, for version 1.7, on Apr 3, 2012
I am a long time satisfied user. Almost 100% satisfied. One negative comment, some restaurants don't monitor the late night ressies and when customer arrives they are closing early. Should be automatic reward of some sort for customer in that situation.

5 stars, "Fabulous", by Puppylover123, for version 1.5, on Apr 3, 2012
So easy, never go anywhere I can't reserve on Open Table. I agree that the only negative is if a restaurant forgets to sign u in you should get a reward instead of an email of inquiry. Great great service otherwise.

The map based search function is very useful but the app automatically resets if you switch apps.

When returning to the opentable app, everything reboots and you lose your existing search.

Use this app all the time when we're on the road to find great new restaurants, as well as when we're home and looking to see who has an open table. So much easier than calling around. Would be 5 stars if more restaurants participated, but I find that most of the good restaurants are on there.

4 stars, "Great app!", by Lgo987, for version 1.7, on Apr 7, 2012
Pluses: great for restaurant ideas &amp; last minute reservations. Easy, fast &amp; let's you make special requests &amp; notify friends by email. The bonus points can be cashed in for gift certificates at any Open Table restaurant.
Downsides: if you leave the app in the middle of a search or reservation you have to start over. If you are looking for a restaurant while on the road the list updates every 1/4 mile or so, making it very difficult to complete your search.

Open Table is essential if you are a busy person who wants to have a great dining experience without making plans far in advance.

I also use it frequently when I am traveling.  This has been my experience for the past three years.

I love Open Table, and the convenience of having on my smartphone and iPad is huge.  The -only- thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is that navigation can be clumsy.   For example, to choose a particular restaurant, I need to choose my time and party size, find what's available at -every- restaurant, and then filter the results.  Can't I just go to the restaurant I want, and see what's available?  Still, the email confirmations are great, and easily forwarded to guests.  Love it!

5 stars, "Incredibly convenient way to plan a night out", by Memphis Jay, for version 1.7, on Apr 14, 2012
I use OpenTable regularly. It's a great way to find restaurants, filter them by several categories (price, cuisine, neighborhood, availability), and lock in a reservation with the opportunity to add special requests. I even end up finding new places through OpenTable along with word of mouth recommendations by people who have dined there so I'm not walking in uninformed. OpenTable focuses on a targeted service and provides it excellently, and the app condenses the convenience of the website to "anywhere with cell reception."

OpenTable is a fantastic concept and now for the smart phone? Yes please! One of my top ten apps. It is so convenient with a filter for specific neighborhoods in every city, price points etc  it also contains link to the restaurants and menus. And because it js integrated with the maps feature in the phones, one tap on the address of any restaurant and you are automatically mapped to the location for easy navigation. The only question would be why you do NOT have it. You will love it.

5 stars, "Wonderful App", by arbman85, for version 1.7, on Apr 24, 2012
Open Table is one of the most convenient apps I use. 

OT has a great selection of quality restaurants and makes it easy to book reservations. 

Everything you need to make an informed decision is within the interface. Menu, location, available times, description of the restaurant, GPS directions, etc are all available at your finger tips. 

OT also has a follow up system so you have proof of your reservation. It has never failed us and the restaurant was always waiting to seat us when we arrived for our reservation. 

I wish all restaurants used OT. It just works!

1 star, "Poor job, doesn't compare well to website", by Timmerbee, for version 1.7, on Apr 25, 2012
I use Open Table a lot, for many years, and am very disappointed by this poorly designed app. Looks like a pre-beta version they just threw out. What a shame, as it will detract from the good name they've built from their website. I've tried to use the app for several weeks but it's so kludge and poorly arranged that inevitably I have to go to the website to actually find a restaurant and make a reservation. App needs a complete do-over.

Specifics:
FIND BY RESTAURANT NAME function apparently cannot work at all, even if you carefully type in the name of a restaurant shown as part of a list on the screen.
Very difficult to change the search location, even if you want to just look outside your immediate vicinity.
Nonintuitive, poorly designed interface.
Crashes a lot, sometimes forcing a restart.
It's truly maddening to try and get this stupid program to just pull up some restaurants so you can make a reservation, and after several weeks of trying I've found that I just drop out and use Safari to go to the Open Table website. The website works, after all.

Open table has a great resource of the finest or most popular restaurants in most cities! I love how easy and user friendly the app is, but I wish there was actual VIP treatment or upgrades for achieving VIP status. Other than that and adding more cities, it's a great app!

Makes it so easy to make rezzies on the fly. One less thing on the to-do list is always a good thing. Thanks Open Table. 

Suggestions for restaurants would be nice sometimes because (at least in SF) if you don't have a place in mind the list can be overwhelming.

Not only is this app perfect, there are really attentive people behind it. I was denied a table at a restaurant a few weeks ago, despite a reservation, because they had a private party going on. I wrote a letter to open table and was answered with a personalized response by the next morning, including reinstating the points for the reservation times two. Great customer service!

2 stars, "No multitasking support!", by MirrorManExt, for version 1.7, on May 8, 2012
Come on...this app absolutely needs to support multitasking so you can check reviews on Yelp or other websites, or check your calendar before making a reservation. It's maddening that it "reboots" from the beginning every time you switch to another app! We're on iOS 5 already...get with the program...please fix!

I use open table to find restaurants close by at a moment's notice. It's great for planning pre-theater or finding out who's open for lunch. It's easy to make a res and easy to change or cancel. No apologies, just do it.  I especially count on it for travel when I don't know the territory.

4 stars, "Great App, especially when traveling", by Hungry Traveller, for version 1.7.1, on May 24, 2012
I find this app to be very valuable when traveling. I travel for business from time to time and find this app real handy to find good restaurants when I'm on the go(or just plain sitting on my rear end in meetings) and just don't have the time sit on the telephone trying to get through to the restaurant to get reservations for the evening. It's great for finding the location of the restaurant, for its reviews and ratings, for finding price ranges and of course for making it easy to get reservations. I have not experienced problems with crashing, freezing or whatever. I would like to see more restaurants in non major metropolitan areas listed.

So convenient and no hassle, no waiting on the phone, no mistakes. Just wish it had more tables/better time slots  available at the trendier restaurants. Very often, for peak hours, you can't make an opentable reservation but you can very well make one by phone with the restaurant directly or walk in and get a table.

2 stars, "Some updates to be made..", by Hah-pah, for version 1.7.1, on May 29, 2012
I'm a huge fan of opentable - I'm on the site at least once a day. Unfortunately I don't use the app on my iPad or iPhone because of one major flaw...

You can't search more than one location at a time. I often like to plug in 1-4 locations that I'm open to eating in but this doesnt allow me to do that. It's very frustrating to manually search numerous neighborhoods each time.

Secondly, you can't go back to your selection once you click another app. It refreshes instead of stays on your selection. 

I love this site and hope to one day love this app

3 stars, "Just fine", by mcdonowil, for version 1.7.1, on May 31, 2012
Open Table is just fine, but the best restaurants save the prime time tables for their phone customers and don't make them available for the Open Table customers. That's wrong!!!

When I'm using my laptop and click on a link to reserve a table, I often pick up my phone and open the app instead.  It's so much faster and I'm already logged in.  Great app all-around.  Does exactly what you'd want a reservation app to do, nothing more.

4 stars, "Used website open table since 2006, now app", by Robbyd2000, for version 1.7.1, on Jun 1, 2012
I have used open table since 2006 to book reservations. I would rate the app a five if it mimicked the website version better.  I lose some of my favorite features when I use the I-pad app.  While my favorite restaurants will pop up in my account through the app, they are not searchable by city....which is part of my account through the website.  When I travel it is much easier to recall restaurants I want to book if I can keep them categorized by city.  Please add this feature to the app version; otherwise I end up going back to the website version so I have access to all of my account functions.

What a great site.  The mobile site is also one of the best. I book through OT as much as possible. Many times I will go to a restaurant if they have OT. Or sometimes I dont go if I have to call for a reservation.  I have never had a problem with an OT reservation.

This application has opened a whole new way for me to try new foods without having to worry about if a place I want to try takes reservations or not. It's great for Mothers/Fathers/Easter day brunches and because it has a confirmation number associated with the reservation, you don't have I worry about your reservation being lost.

Been using open table for years now and truly love this easy to use App for booking restaurant reservations. We especially like the review of previous diners when selecting a new location and reviewing the menu. Yes, there are some minor feature improvements that would help and were confident that the people at open table will incorporate into future editions. Keep up the good work!

4 stars, "Helpful app, but still room for improvement", by consultant345, for version 1.7.1, on Jun 9, 2012
I find Open Table very helpful when traveling, particularly in conjunction with Yelp. However, I wish app allowed filtering before searching. Also, some Open Table restaurants do not link with Yelp, so you really have to use both apps independently to get the full benefit of them.

3 stars, "Fails to Store Info", by Stumblefoot, for version 1.7.1, on Jun 9, 2012
During the reservation confirmation process, if you choose to enter a special request, the app opens a new screen for the request.  After you enter your request and save it, the app returns you to the reservation confirmation page where you will have to re-enter your telephone number and answer whether this is your first time dining at the restaurant again.

5 stars, "Really great app! A++", by Jen Mcgurk, for version 1.7, on Jun 11, 2012
So easy!! I literally make reservations as I'm walking into a restaurant from my phone. It takes 2 seconds to do, so even if you have a hard time planning in advance and you're not super picky, you can use the app to get points even on the fly. For restaurants that fill up quickly, it's good to use in advance too. Either way, just 2500 points gets you a free gift certificate!! Just 10 1000 point reservations and you get $100!! Why wouldn't you use it??

4 stars, "Great app but needs some work", by JoseL.E., for version 1.7.1, on Jun 12, 2012
It's a great app but I have two complaints.
This app was put in the app store for apple devices but apple devices don't use flash yet some of the menus require flash in order to view them.  
Second thing is that I hate having to start my search all over again from the very beginning when I want to initiate a new search.
How about a "back" button so that I can go back to the previous page not the beginning.
Besides these two complaints I think this is a great idea for an app!

One of the most helpful apps to have. Super-easy to use and navigate and, most importantly, gives you the opportunity to make changes to a reservation on the spot, like if you are running late. Wish more restaurants would sign up to participate. And yes, some restaurants will show no availability for larger groups on Open Table for their busy times but if you call, you can probably get a table.

5 stars, "Awesome app!", by jhunted321, for version 1.7.1, on Jun 17, 2012
I adore using open table to make reservations.  I can put in special requests (flowers, birthday, please seat us on the patio), book a reservation while I am on the phone with our dinner guests, and then shoot my guest a copy of the dinner reservation with one click!  I can also find a restaurant near my locale with availability the time and date I desire it.

Easy to use but sometimes seems unable to recognize restaurants with small errors in typing. Also would like to see an expanded time window of availability for restaurants you want to hit and don't care when. Cheers!

4 stars, "Open Table Rocks", by Halimony, for version 1.5, on Jun 17, 2012
It's awesome especially when traveling into unknown territory. We were in a restaurant one night with a 45 minute wait and I went in to Open table and made a reservation so we only had to wait 10 minutes. Would like to be able to pick more neighborhoods at a time.

I love to read reviews that I feel confident that people have actually dined there. Since I know the quality of my local restaurants that are on Open Table it helps when I am visiting somewhere new. I love the convenience of booking whenever I want to and getting instant confirmation.  Always use it when dining out if I can.

5 stars, "Recommendation for OpenTable", by Zsuzsanna D-K, for version 1.7.1, on Jun 18, 2012
I have been using OpenTable for about 10 years and it just never fails. I appreciate the ease of use with minor issues like when I change the reservation's time it generates multiple entries for the restaurant instead of updating the original. On my end it updates perfectly so I never miss a table. Thank you for the years of help OpenTable!

I use this app all the time. I travel for business and I'm able to scope out restaurants and make reservations before getting into town. The reviews have not steered me wrong yet. 

I also use it at home to make local reservations. When a non-OpenTable restaurant messed up our diner reservations, I used OpenTable to find immediate open tables at other nearby restaurants. 

Love it!

5 stars, "The Best Way to Make a Dining Reservation", by Dines Out Often, for version 1.7.1, on Jun 20, 2012
As far as I am concerned, Open Table is the best way to make a dining reservation. For last minute reservations one knows immediately what is available. For advance reservations special requests are easily added. A confirmation is always populated!  So easy! And available 24/7.

5 stars, "Model App", by Pansloth, for version 1.7.1, on Jun 20, 2012
This app:
1. Never crashes. 
2. Never takes too long to load. 
3. Works for every city or area I am. 
4. Is useful for planning ahead or spur I the moment reservations. 
5. Is FREE and earns me gift cards for me essentially doing nothing except taking 10 seconds to make a reservation. 
6.  A great tool for reviews of restaurants. 
7. A great tool to find NEW restaurants.

I love this app and use it all the time.

OpenTable is fantastic! The app is very convenient and user friendly. There are some minor limitations, which can be inconvenient but are relatively easy to get around.
Pros:
Easy to use
Get credit towards gift certificate at participating restaurants simply for making and keeping reservations

Cons:
Phone numbers are not included in restaurant details. 
Restaurants limit tables/times available for on-line booking
Search function does not allow you to choose multiple options for a feature (e.g. Location, cuisine)

Overall very useful for those who like to dine out.

Easy to use, best way to book a table. This is absolutely one of my top 3 apps based on usage. It is indispensable. Recent updates brought welcome improvements: remembers where you were in transaction when you switch apps and come back; doesn't crash at all (rarely did before). Only wish that one could search by map (not display results on a map - this is can do - but allow you to scroll to a city area and search for restaurants in that area (a la Redfin RealEstate). Otherwise, fantastic app.

Can't remember what you last searched so if you are going from app to IM for example you will have to start your search over every time. Can't search multiple neighborhoods at once or favorite places you frequent. Can't share a place you're considering w friends or once you've made a rezo, unless you count email for latter, but that's no longer so useful. 

It was a good app when it came out, but desperately needs an update.

I've been using now for several years, since OT's early days. I don't know how I managed reservations without it. Can't imagine having to call place after place looking for an opening. We eat out a lot and I never give a thought to whether we'll find a table.  Even if our faves are booked, OT is a great way to try setting new. And then we earn points for discounted meals. A no brainer.

The subject line gives my rating in a nutshell. The best testimony to the effectiveness of this app is when I visited a very busy restaurant without a reservation and  was told there was a one hour away. I then checked OpenTable and saw that there was a reservation slot open within the next 15 minutes. I selected it, confirmed it, walked back in, and was immediately seated. Awesome!

I only dine at restaurants that take reservations. I don't want to get there and wait. my time is valuable to me. Price is not an issue. Open Table is one of my favorite pass and I don't know what I would do without it. It literally helps me find restaurants I have never dined at and is super convenient. Some restaurants block times off Open Table, help them to not do this by requesting a credit card to reserve the reservation. If you no show, you should be charged $25 rain check. That's fair.

I have been an Open Table user forever it seems. It is my number one recommendation to friends and business associates that enjoy fine dining. It provides easy reservation access to restaurants I know, but more importantly introduces me to new places with a wealth of information. Probably the best value however is I have confidence in the reviews. Open Table has posted my disappointments equally with my raves. Congratulations folks, you've developed a great business model.

How did we ever make it this long w/o Open Table!? Any restaraunt that wants to be successful &amp; truly serve it's customer's best interest needs to be on open table. Anymore, if it's a choice between a place on OT and one that's not, I book the Open Table restaraunt because it's much more convenient for me &amp; I'd rather support an establishment that is helping making it easier for its customers to book than one that's not.

I absolutely love Open Table! Every restaurant should be a part of it if not already. I always use this site to reserve my restaurant reservations. It's easy to use on your computer or phone (the App is awesome). Whether I'm looking for a type of food, a neihborhood gem or just a last minute reservation. It's all conveniently there in seconds! Plus the comulative points are a bonus!

3 stars, "Helpful for reservations", by Laura Warren, for version 1.7.1, on Jul 16, 2012
We use opentable all of the time all over the country as we travel often and eat out last minute quite alot. I have only had problems a couple of times when I didn't receive my points which can be very frustrating, especially when they were 1000 point restaurant reservations, and even after contacting opentable customer service we still did not receive the points. 
Also there are times when it says on opentable there are no reservations but when you call you can get a table.
Otherwise it's a helpful app.

2 stars, "Wish it were like their website", by Practicality First, for version 1.8.1, on Jul 16, 2012
While I really like OpenTable's website, their iPad app is woefully inadequate.  It's difficult to search by restaurant name when you choose a geographical area and know the restaurant you want, and once you make a reservation and want to send the info to other members of your party, it takes you away from their app to your email account and only includes the name of the restaurant with the date and time of the reservation . . . It doesn't even include the restaurant address!!  I ended up closing the app and using OpenTable's website on my iPad.

We like to be able to look up a restaurant and make a reservation all in one place.  The reviews are very helpful when trying a new restaurant.  The only criticism we have is that some times a restaurant shows no availability at a specific time but if you call them you can often get the reservation you want.  I don't know if some places block out busy times or why this happens.

My group is very frequent foodies to Delia's, the taste and quality are always above the industry standard, but recently the service by the new batch of servers are terribly poor, especially the twos with initial A and E. To us, it looks as if these two servers are lack of products' knowledges on the foods and drinks. They looked very confused when being ask on foods and drinks. We ordered CC and Ginger Ale, the server with initial A doesn't know what is it? Then we ordered Straffie Quad beer, he told us, we don't carry this beer! It so ridiculous and laughing stock that we as customers have to point it to him on the drink menu. OMG !? It insults our intelligence. Fortunately, we are regulars, if not this is our last visit to Delia's.It seem to us, they are not fit to be servers. We love Delia's very much, therefore, we took the effort and trouble to write this review in order Delia's will not losing customers because of poor service and few incapable servers. However,we will not stop visiting Delia's but we will definitely request our choice of servers e.g Dina, Tai or Mohd.

This app is very slow, maybe because it's using your location.

You have to start over, finding the restaurant, picking the time and so on. It is very frustrating!!!

The only way to make reservations. OpenTable makes making restaurant reservations so easy. I never want to have to call a restaurant again. It is so great to pick a specific time in your area and see what restaurants are available. Also great to see what restaurants are most popular and difficult to get into for future reference. One of my top five favorite must-have apps.
Works wonderfully when you are traveling also!

I have had an APP for Open Table for my Blackberry as well iPad.  It is an excellent way to find a place with a table especially at the last minute.

I absolutely love Open table's 
app. I use it everywhere and find it to also be the perfect tool when traveling. And, the little bonus checks after 20 reservations are a sweet little perk!  I'm disappointed when a restaurant isn't on Open Table. Thanks, Open Table- you're the best!

I always check first to see if a restaurant is a member of Open Table and if not, change to a restaurant that is a member because previous diners' reviews are very important to me. Only problem with OT is that the availability times are not always accurate- I can usually call a restaurant and secure my preferred reservation time, but don't get credit on O T because the reservation was not made on Internet.

2 stars, "Opentable review", by Aerlian, for version 1.8.1, on Aug 3, 2012
This app is okay but its really nothing amazing. It still crashes far too often and the user interface is not conducive to the goal of booking a table. For example, if I choose a time of 6.30pm on Friday and I say to my girlfriend 'okay there's a table at 6.30pm' and she then says 'oh I forgot I have after work drinks how about 9pm'...well tell me how many clicks its going to take me to find that out? Answer: I have to go back to the start all over again. I work as a software engineer in my day job...it's not hard to imagine changing the flow of this app to be a lot better - if I had to guess then I'd say they had an intern build it and haven't got anyone else working on it

3 stars, "Great app but location services need adjustment", by iPad open table, for version 1.8.1, on Aug 4, 2012
I love the app but it needs a little more versatility. Presently, you can search by a specific location but not easily. You are forced into using location services and have to find a way around this function in order to search without using this tool. It would be great to be able to pick neighborhoods without using location services like the full site.

Once again recommended this app to a friend.  I am a traveler for business and pleasure, a bit of a foodie, but not much of a snob.  I have used this app all over the place for years (?) and have yet to be disappointed.  I haven't researched their criteria or methods, but this is the best of all restaurant apps for me.  We were the first guests at a San Diego eatery via Open Table and that was my only other time to write a review (it was very positive.)  Sometimes I cross check with other apps for seriously ethnic cuisines, but have never been steered wrong here.  More often, I have been delightfully shocked.  This is the best in the category period.

We travel a lot and like to try new restaurants. This app is always reliable and easy to use to make the reservation!  It's also great to make a reservation on the fly when your out sight seeing. Neve made a reservation that didn't work. Can't ask for more.

4 stars, "Opentable", by Love using this site, for version 1.8.1, on Aug 18, 2012
I dont write reviews very often if ever!  However, yesterday my family of 4, two adults and twin 13 year olds, discussed how great Opentable is!!!!  Its not just the ease of use, but in general the quality of restaurants is far superior to any other dining and/or reservation site.  Sometimes I regret that I can not find enough choices when traveling, but usually that means that the quality of restaurants is not so good in that particular area.

This app works well. Gives the functionality that you need. The only thing that I wish was available was the highlighted special programs, like restaurant week. On the full site, you can navigate through a filtered list of participants. Doesn't give that option via the app.

I love Open Table, but the iPhone and iPad app is very limited. Can't filter by anything (neighborhood, price range, cuisine, etc) so I always end up scrolling from the beginning. I eat at a lot of places that start with A when I reserve using the app.

4 stars, "Open Table ala iPad", by AplPhanBoy, for version 1.8.1, on Aug 21, 2012
Being a long time OT user on my iMac, took me a little time to fully learn the small UI differences. Not a real problem in that I'm still getting used to the differences between OS X &amp; iOS. Nice to be able to use OT wherever I am and a pleasure to see hoe their coverage has expanded!

4 stars, "Need an update", by Bkwerner, for version 1.8.1, on Aug 22, 2012
I have been a loyal OpenTable member for years, and have used the app religiously since it launched. The features are easy and appealing, but you really need an update that keeps the app from crashing, which happens almost every time. I also recommend checking so that when a user tries to go 'back' during a search, it goes back to the same search vs. very first screen.

When you stop the crashing, it will be terrific.
--
2 stars, "Kind of a pain", by Nicki-426, for version 1.8.1, on Aug 22, 2012
Way inferior to the website - Typing in a restaurant name before the city leads to lots of "not found" messages, and it's annoying that it doesn't remember what your default city is. If you try to search by city/ time, scrolling through 20 listings at a time alphabetically is a hassle. You can't sort by cuisine or rating. Also, it doesn't give you the listing options that the website has (best for foodies, best Italian, etc)

restaurant. If you need to call the restaurant, you have to google the number. This is a great

4 stars, "Overall good, but some quirks", by michlav, for version 1.5, on Aug 26, 2012
Sometimes it can be difficult to find a restaurant even though you know it's offered by OpenTable. You should be able to type in a name and just zip code rather than by current location. Sometimes when i click on their city choices it chooses the one above the city i tap. I wish i could write reviews, if it offers this function i can't seem to find it.

5 stars, "Really Useful App!!", by Laser_Dude, for version 1.8.1, on Aug 27, 2012
This is an app I use all the time. It's my first choice when I need to find a dinner reservation. I also use it for my regular favorites - a quick way to build up reward points. If only EVERY great restaurant was listed on OpenTable (unfortunately, some are not.)

This app integrates well with Maps, Safari, Mail, and Calendar. It all just works! Try it!

5 stars, "Super good - but keep going", by Rovster, for version 1.8.1, on Aug 28, 2012
It's funny - the app works well once you find the right buttons.  If you do not log out, it performs best.  
Keep improving the location of the buttons and way it guides you in the beginning.  Think like a first time user!!!
Other than that, it's straightforward and does what it is supposed to!

Since restaurants tend to drop out if they receive less than 4 stars, only the best rated ones are usually remaining on the list. This in itself is a useful process. The rebate program is a good feature too.

3 stars, "Two limitations that are frustrating", by BostonAreaDiner, for version 1.8.1, on Aug 30, 2012
This app is great for the basics of making a reservation at a restaurant I already know I want to go. But it has limitations that the web site doesn't. One thing I don't like is that if I want to filter the general location  by neighborhood, I can only choose one location at a time. Second, when the list of restaurants is limited until one taps "load more results,"  the "load more results" button is blocked by an ad. It is possible that these limitations can be overcome by knowing more than I do about the iPad. If that is the case, I welcome input!

The Open Table app is very user friendly and allows us the chance to explore new restaurants in our foodie friendly community.  At times we get stuck going to our "favorites" and stopping to look at Open Table availability provides inspiration to try new places or old favorites that we may forget about...

3 stars, "Not convenient", by TnT Philly, for version 1.8.1, on Sep 15, 2012
This app could be a lot better - the functionalities are very limited. When you select a restaurant and a time, you can't easily change the time and you have to do a whole new search. The map function doesn't work well either. If you look in your current location for a restaurant and you try to expand the search area, it doesn't work. The search filters are very limited too. This app is only good if you know what restaurant you want to go it and at what time, not to get ideas.

If you want to change things, choose multiple neighborhoods, look for alternative times, the app needs improvement. Navigation is getting better, but further updates needed.  Concept and product is great, but app is just so so (but free).

Changing times for pre-selected restaurant needs fix ASAP.  Let suppose you are looking for time at popular restaurant, and no times available in your defined window...  Make it easier to select "next available" within a defined time.

Awesome app.  We use all of the time, even in Las Vegas where I have casino hosts to make reservations for us, this is easier... Just touch and done.  Reservations are always there and ready.  Occasionally host will drop the ball with regard to time and/or location when scheduling different numbers of guests at different restaurants on different nights.  We would like to see 'Favorites' list separated into locations to make it easier to make reservations when traveling, this would be especially helpful for restaurants we visit in multiple cities.

--
3 stars, "Good but needs improvement", by SF/NY/LA, for version 1.8.1, on Sep 25, 2012
Very quick and convenient but has some major bugs. For example, it won't let me save neighborhoods or remember from previous searches so I always start from scratch ticking off the neighborhoods I'm interested in. This is more annoying still because it resets my search every time I change the location - for example, if looking at Italian restaurants in the Marina for 830 slots, if I drag the map down to the Mission, instead of sowing Italian 830s there it will reset the search to all restaurants in the Mission. This makes the app good for booking a specific restaurant and weak for discovering what's available by changing single parameters while holding the other variables constant.
--
2 stars, "Adequate, Just", by John Selzer, for version 1.8.2, on Sep 25, 2012

3 stars, "Alright, prefer to use on computer if avail", by Jhinnyc, for version 1.8.1, on Sep 25, 2012
I find this app just okay, not good. I use Open Table all the time, and find the app more difficult than just using my computer, which allows for easier navigation. It seems to have improved a bit lately, i couldn't find the neighborhood breakdown for Manhattan til tonite! So I wonder if it's new? If it's not, then it definitely needs to be more intuitive in finding it.

I found this to be excellent and far superior to the iPhone version. It includes a very useful moving/zoom-able map of your area (Google Maps) which will auto-populate restaurants in that area whenever you hit 'Reresh'. This is great for discovering new places, and also to jog your memory about a place that you know exists in a certain part of town - but can't remember the name. 

Booking a reservation was easy and fast as always, and it includes a handy summary of all your recent activity.    

Overall, an excellent app which is easy to use and well designed.

I have had an ongoing question for some time over why I do not always get dining credits at some establishments, even tho I have used the system to make the reservation. I have not been able to find a means of asking the question to anyone at Open Table.

5 stars, "Hawks Restaurant", by Foody Lovers, for version 1.8.2, on Oct 2, 2012
It's easy to reserve a table using Open Table. We've been very pleased with their service and especially
Enjoy the food. The selection and quality is on a par with some of the best restaurants I've eaten at. Everything is home-made and the 2'nd Sunday brunches are a wonderful way to meet our foody friends. Lovely environment, good food...what more could one ask for?

Open table has served us well over the years. Yes, sometimes the navigation is sticky, and yes, the coordination between the app and the restaurant is sometimes not tight enough, but, hey, how much entitlement do you need? Overall, it's a very convenient site.

I've been using open table for years in London and I was so sad to see Top Table take over. But now I have a big smile again because it's still available Stateside!  It's so easy to use and being able to see availability and book your table real-time is fantastic.

2 stars, "No Siri Support in iOS 6", by starfx6464, for version 1.8.2, on Oct 5, 2012
Not a bad app, but while they supposedly updated for iOS 6 support, Siri still needs the iPhone version to make reservations.  Also, Retina display support is still sorely missing as well. It seems as if they've simply chosen to pretend the third generation iPad doesn't exist.

I humbly suggest unifying the two apps and making the iPhone version universal to support both devices in their native resolutions.  Otherwise, an update to address these two quirks would be much appreciated.

5 stars, "If Restaurant are not on opentable, I'm not going!!!", by IVANO TOGNI, for version 1.8.2, on Oct 7, 2012
Not many apps makes your life easier, this is it. Do you remember when we used to try to find the phone number of a restaurant and make a reservation? That was the past now you have opentable. 
I use this app every time I make a reservation (every other day) and if a restaurant is not on opentable then I would not go. All the best restaurant are in here and if a restaurant wants to cheap out and not join opentable, tough luck.

3 stars, "All the same features, some glitches", by chaatie, for version 1.8.2, on Oct 10, 2012
Just tried to make my first reservation using the iPad app. It's got all the features you'd expect. But when trying to enter a "special request," you can't Confirm your reservation because the keyboard is in the way. So you gotta skip telling the restaurant that it is a special occasion or you need handicap access or have a show to make, etc. so I guess for this reservation I will use the website until this glitch is fixed...

I use OpenTable almost exclusively to make my dinner and lunch reservations.

You know that instant when you submit your date and time who can take your reservation request! Love it !!!

The right column "paging" is hard to use when sifting through lots of results.

Also, I had to sift through lots of results because my desired restaurant name couldn't be searched, even though I already had 2 reservations setup for it on different days (done on the iPhone app).

5 stars, "Frequent Traveler - Easy solution to find good places to eat!", by MGoody250, for version 1.8.2, on Oct 23, 2012
I am on the road frequently, and use this app when in new locations to find good places to dine. 90% of the time the table is ready onetime - if not a short wait. To be fair I usually reserve with very short notice. 
Restaurants on the app are usually of good quality and it is a great way to experience new places instead of the usual "middle America" mainstream chains. 
I recommend the app.
Eat well.

5 stars, "Open Table Review", by Sports lady61, for version 1.8.2, on Oct 23, 2012
I love using Open Table because it is very user friendly, fast, and keeps me from having to call the restaurants to make the reservations. I get immediate confirmation. In the past when I would call the restaurants direct I would have to make sure they were open and even then I might get a recording, then would have to wait for them to call me back to confirm. I would recommend this app for anyone who dines out very often. It certainly makes my life a lot easier!

4 stars, "Improving but still lacks features", by Aredubyou, for version 4.0, on Nov 11, 2012
The app has definitely improved since I first started using it.  It now remembers my settings, allows me to invite friends, and is much more usable.  My main criticism at this point is that I can't search by neighborhood, only by city or current location.

Original review:
I love OpenTable but not this app.  It doesn't start searching on your home location. Doesn't remember previous settings - closing the app to do something like look at a calendar entry or map sets you back to the home page and you have to start your search all over. Can't select a neighborhood until you've run a search. And even though I'm logged and the site knows my contact info it made me fill in my phone #. Took 3 tries since it wouldn't take dashes and required the area code. Then, when I added a special request, the phone # was deleted and I had to enter it a 4th time. Finally, there's no option to invite others - looks like you have to go to their web site for those features. Major usability issues on my most recent try.   It forgets my password, and when I minimize the app to find that it forgets the reservation I was making.  I start over and this time it's forgotten both my username and password.  Very frustrating.

I use Open-table whenever and where- ever I book a restaurant. 
It makes booking so much easier. What I really love is the instant use. When we think in the moment, let's go out for dinner, I just use the app on my iPhone to check where there is a table available. Within a couple of minutes we know where to go. 
I also appreciate the customer reviews a d use then to decide upon a new restaurant.

I love using open table on my iPad and have been a user for years.  I would love to be able to search any city or town regardless of my current location.  It is very difficult to do so if you are not looking for a specific metropolitan area but are curious about restaurants in more suburban areas.  I'm resigned to have to use urbanspoon which is not as convenient.  I've also been repeatedly kicked out of the app for some reason while trying to search.  So much potential though.

3 stars, "Mostly great but quirky", by zadnor, for version 4.0, on Nov 13, 2012
When it works right, it's simple, quick and easy. But sometimes it just takes you to restaurant or date without ever asking and it's a pain to get to where you can just put in the restaurant, date, and number of diners. It should just go directly to that. In their desire to save you a couple seconds they often cost you a couple minutes.

5 stars, "Awesome App", by ase1707, for version 4.0, on Nov 14, 2012
If one had to choose just one app to put on his/her iPhone and/or iPad, Open Table would be the choice by far.  Not only is it good for reservations, but it is an excellent source for finding the perfect restaurant for your needs.  Much better than Yelp, this is clearly my favorite app.

This is a great app. After you accrue enough points, you get a gift check to use at one of the Open Table restaurants which is a nice perk. I like the convenience of making a reservation this way. Not good for a large party which I understand but ideal for parties of two or four.

5 stars, "Open Table iPad", by Clubking, for version 4.0, on Nov 14, 2012

They ask for a phone number...if you put hyphens in the number like every phone number in the world, you get an error on submit..."phone number must be numeric". Problem is that there is no way to correct it and no way to start over. If you close the reservation and start the search over it automatically brings up the same reservation with the same error.  Ended up calling the restaurant directly.

If anyone told me a few years ago that I'd have the ability to make restaurant reservations in a few seconds without having to speak with anyone, let alone sit on a dead line while waiting for a response, well.......!

Love it, especially when you get points/discounts for doing something you were going to do anyway.....!!

Long may Open Table reign!

5 stars, "Probably our most used App", by britva, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 5, 2012
Truly Excellent. On the road just call up the city (may have to delve a bit to locate smaller cities) and see what's available, what people think and if you like what you see, press the book button! 

Annoyingly some places (mostly in DC for some reason) seem not to trust it and require you to call and them and confirm if they don't get you when they call you, which kinda defeats the point. But this isn't OT's fault.

3 stars, "OK", by T19147f56b2hjk, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 5, 2012
Open Table for iPad is OK but not great.  Many functions missing and too much searching for things.  It's a bit too cumbersome for me.  I'll use it out of convenience for the simpler things but really prefer using on a real PC.

5 stars, "Absolutely a Great App!", by Thomas J Angley, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 5, 2012
I have been using this app for a few years and it has never done me wrong! I love the reviews. It truely helps me decide on the restaurant and I can't say enough on how easy the app works when making a reservation. Never had it not work for me. I just love it!
--
4 stars, "Use it often", by TWBK, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 6, 2012
I love the app!  Sometimes, however, it will tell me a listed restaurant is unavailable for reservations, with no reason.  I've called the restaurants directly after getting this message, and they tell me they have a limit to online reservations, or, they only take  parties smaller than I was trying to book (I wanted 6, the restaurant allowed up to 4).  I wish Open Table had a way to tell me this prior to me having to find out the issue.  Otherwise I have no complaints and find it very useful.

2 stars, "Great site poor app", by Chef law, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 6, 2012
Opentable is the best website for people who love to eat out.  However, the app falls far short of the site.  The worst part about the app is the limited number of restaurants you can view at once.  It is very time consuming going screen to screen and I find myself spending further time trying to narrow down a few restaurants before i even use the app just to save myself mental aggravation.

3 stars, "Convenient but limited", by Stuudy, for version 4.0, on Dec 8, 2012
Like most Apple iPad/iPhone apps, they are not as robust the PC or MAC versions.  However, the convenience of the iPad can't be beat.  The one item I miss is a URL link to the restaurant's website.  iPad apps are not good switching from one to another and back.  I know that in come cases the "menu" button does open a window to the restaurant,  but it's not consistent.  Getting to the website usually allow you to see more pictures of the establishment.  Would like to see this be more consistent.  The Map integration is very good and the app is faster than the Web version.  I have seen steady improvement.  Over time, I expect that to continue.  So overall, they get 3 stars.

4 stars, "Love it", by nducoff, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 8, 2012

4 stars, "Very good app", by Jens Holmark Andersen, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 9, 2012
Very good first attempt from Opentable.
I still find the right bar with restaurants a bit "clunky".
Maybe I haven't used it enough, but it is always alpha sorted, and does not let you scroll, but you are forced to use the buttons. Really minor things which need tweaking, so definitely recommend the app as is.

4 stars, "Nice graphics but search could be a bit easier", by Pieroinusa, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 12, 2012
Navigation and graphics are great. Performance is very good. Works well with location services. A bit harder to look for a restaurant in a new area as the pull down menu does not always provide a granular enough selection. Would be good to have a zip code or town based search.
I use this application a lot because this is an excellent service with very good restaurants. I hope they will keep adding new good places.

This app has saved me countless phone calls and searching for the best restaurants in any area of country that we travel to.

It is truly a wonderful service enabled by a flawless app. Thanks so much!

This is one of the most seamless, smooth apps out there by far, but especially for anybody looking to reserve a dining spot, it is simply the best.  I've tried this at home and on the road, and it is just exactly what a good app should be.  The posted reviews are a gold mine of information, and the one click reservation feature is king.  You won't go wrong here.

3 stars, "Generally good app", by Donducker, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 29, 2012
My two frustrations are that the app provides suggested times, and if you want something other than those, there is no obvious facility for picking a different time.  You are almost better off going to the website instead.  The other issue I have is that there seem to be restaurants that participate in Open Table, but are not displayed on the selection list in the app.  If you go to the restaurant's website, you get a link to OT. Other than that, it is a nice app, particularly good when you travel and are looking for restaurants nearby.

4 stars, "Useful!", by MLWine, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 29, 2012

Eat out a few times a week.  Travel frequently.  Open Table is very convenient and easy to use.  Not most important, but do enjoy points.  Besides setting reservation, users can also benefit from being recognized as knowledgeable and experienced.  And well run establishments will cater to this, if you happen to have real personal favorites which you frequent, those restaurants will really appreciate your reviews.

The only bug I have found is that I have encountered issues when trying to cancel a reservations. On one occasion I had canceled my reservation and the application did not process correctly, I received a reprimand call for from Open Table. I was not happy with that.

Otherwise everything has worked very well.

I have been using Open Table since long before apps.  This is one of my favorite apps. It is easy to use, gets the job done, and makes the whole transaction seamless.

5 stars, "Great Tool", by Bainbridge Island Bound, for version 4.2, on Jan 20, 2013
The best app ever.

As middle aged food and wine lovers, we use it regularly both here in Cincinnati, and ion our many our travels (Indy, Cleveland, Columbus, Lexington, Seattle, Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Ann Arbor, Maine, Louisville, Dayton, Richmond - and many other destinations). Convenient, easy, quick &amp; we love those dining "points".  Perhaps our most used app.

5 stars, "Great while on the road", by srso4, for version 4.2, on Jan 21, 2013
App is easy to use and is at its best while you're traveling.  Search current location lands tables nearest your spot--handy especially if you're not familiar with the area.  It's a little harder when you want to change search areas to something specific somewhere else. Just searching on a restaurant name does not bring up a list of choices unless you also match the location, no matter how unique the name.

4 stars, "I use it and like it", by VT4Obama, for version 4.2, on Jan 21, 2013
First, thank you to all of you restaurant reviewers who share your experiences with us.  I rarely enter a new restaurant for dinner without some research.  Forewarned is forearmed.

Except for some difficulty changing location to a city where I am not, this app is easy to use and gets you a large amount of restaurant info in short order.  Pick a place and bang you're reserved.

We use it more often than we should!?

4 stars, "Terrific app!", by GerryDoc, for version 4.2, on Jan 21, 2013
This does what it says. Lets you look at restaurants and easily see reviews, check menus and make reservations. In addition, bonus points are available for reserving through them. Very nice interface on the iPad; also pretty good on iPhone. 
One star lost for their annoying habit of asking me to log in on Facebook when I'm already logged in to the app. If I want everyone to know where I am all the time, I'll tell them myself.

The only reason I gave this 4* is because I wonder if sometimes they only get the weird hour reservations like really early  or really late.   Otherwise I like being able to make reservations when it is out of normal operating hours for the restaurant.

5 stars, "Luv2dine", by trackrunner95, for version 4.2, on Jan 22, 2013
I use open table every time I need to make a reservation. It's fast, and easy.  It gives me restaurants in my surrounding area, times available and makes the reservation.  I even get reminder e-mails. 
Although many restaurants are on open table, I wish more restaurants would sign up with this service, so it would be one stop shopping. There are still quite a few restaurants that do not subscribe.

3 stars, "Works well, mostly", by asdlkjfasd, for version 4.2, on Jan 23, 2013
Opentable, as a service, is great.  I've used it for many years.  The app also works, but needs some human factors improvements in the navigation.

There have been many times I've been searching, and needed to change a parameter, but "couldn't get there from here" and had to start over from the beginning.  This is particularly annoying when trying to look up a few specific restaurants and all you want to change is the name. Or you want the same restaurant, but change the date.

4 stars, "Okay but", by Patrick Stoneking, for version 4.2, on Jan 24, 2013
The app is okay but frustrating.  When you search on a specific restaurant for a specific day you cannot easily change dates if not times are available.  You have to start your search all over again.  Why?!?  I am already at the restaurant page, I just want to search for available times on a new date!  Seems like a poor design to me.  I use this app multiple times a week and it is an endless frustration.
--
5 stars, "So darn easy...", by What can be is?, for version 4.2, on Jan 24, 2013
Who could ask for an easier app to make reservations and notify friends. This app is great.  Why any restaurant wouldn't want to participate is beyond me. Thanks for this app.

4 stars, "Reservation times artificially limited", by Jjhowlett, for version 4.0.1, on Jan 24, 2013
A little awkward that you have to pick the time before you can choose the place.  While I understand that available restaurants by time is a valid choice I think that available times for a chosen restaurant should also be possible for the iPad or iPhone user.

5 stars, "A most useful App", by Akn101, for version 4.2, on Jan 24, 2013

--
4 stars, "Almost perfect", by 703TSH, for version 4.2, on Jan 24, 2013
By far the best such reservation app I have seen -- the photos and map graphics are retina display-quality, it loads quickly (unlike CityEats), it is stable (also unlike CityEats), and it has by far the greatest number of restaurants to choose from.

If I had any minor complaints it would be these: a) you should be able to select multiple discriminators (neighborhoods, cuisines, etc.) in a single search; and b) more attention should be paid to keeping menu links current (one of our favorite restaurant's linked menu is from 2009), though this is a shared restaurant-OpenTable burden.

4 stars, "A Great App that Can use some improvement.", by Geofferwok, for version 4.2, on Jan 26, 2013
A real help in allowing you to plan ahead, make restaurant reservations, and to discover new restaurants in areas that you are not familiar with.  The app could be improved with a number of small upgrades including: quicker load time for the iPad; carrying over restaurant info such as the address to the review page;  making it easier to search and locate restaurants in non- major metropolitan areas for travelers; providing a map tab in addition to the existing "description" and "diner review" tabs, and  giving users a better interface for commenting upon restaurant value and pricing.

If I can't make a reservation using Open Table, I don't. I've been using the iPhone app since its inception. The iPad app is better. EVERYTHING you need to make a decision while traveling or whether to try a new restaurant at home is in this app. 

Frankly, there is little I can think of to make this foodie happier! I travel quite a bit and Open Table is indispensable! Menus, reviews, directions, it's all here. 

I have tons of points. I cash them in once in awhile and, voila, free food!

Never once had a screw up! Can you say the same about human reservations?

If you dine, this iPad app should be on your first page.

4 stars, "Convenient and Charming", by roddyrealtor, for version 4.0.1, on Jan 27, 2013
I find the app very easy to use and use it locally and when traveling.  I have had reservations lost at the restaurant or cancelled abruptly by the host restaurant; however, I take accountability that sometimes I have to cancel, too. For the most part, it's a fun and addictive way of finding new restaurants.  It would be nice to see more "off the beaten path" options and I'm still not sure how the loyalty program works, yet it far and above beats having no other option at all.  I'll still use it and look forward to improvements.

I've been happy with and a frequent user of both my online and berry-based versions of Open Table for 7 years.  Got an iPad recently and was very excited to see yet another great tool from Open Table.  It's very easy to navigate and very useful for finding out what's around that's been "vetted" by NYSE Open Table community.

I travel for business and pleasure and my only disappointment is that some of the places that I visit either don't have a restaurant worthy of inclusion or are too out of the way/off the beaten path to be included....finding a good meal those nights is much tougher !!

I signed on with Open Table before Apps were available and used it only once or twice as there were limited choices available.  Now they have grown, added apps and expanded exponentially the numbers and choices of restaurants.

How easy is it to look at a variety of cuisines, menus and reviews by other Open Table users and then pick a time and press submit. Seconds later I have a confirmed reservation.  Wow!  No more making multiple phone calls to check for availability or if reservations are accepted at all.

One of the best travel apps available.  Works just as well at home too.

The iPad app is easy to use once one figures out the changes from the original web site reservation process. However, if one logs in before making a reservation, one gets stuck in one's account with list of outstanding reservations and it is difficult to navigate to where one can make a new reservation. Perhaps this is only an issue with IPad application.

5 stars, "Great local restaurant/bar", by MsABM, for version 4.2, on Jan 31, 2013
Food is always prepared well, and the service is friendly and spot-on. Cocktails are the star of the show: interesting, creative and delicious. Place is noisy, though. And I sometimes wish for more variety on the menu. On the whole, though, this is one of my all-time favorite local restaurants.

5 stars, "Why not use an app that sells your restaurant?", by Larry Rupp, for version 4.2, on Feb 1, 2013
I use this app for personal and business purposes to find a romantic spot for my wife and I - or to find a business lunch or dinner place in a city I'm not familiar.  Would like to see the International cities expand more broadly.

2 stars, "Had this for more than a year and has been worthless the whole time", by Redduke916, for version 4.2, on Feb 1, 2013
This app is useless.  Most great restaurants aren't in the system.  The reservation system is useless.  It claims the first available reservation is at 9:00 pm and when we get there the restaurant is empty.  The hostess says, yes we have plenty of room long before 9:00, you should have called.  This app is getting deleted.  It has never done reservations.  The recommendations may be OK but why use them if you can't use the rest of the app.  I'd rather use yelp.  At least they don't pretend to link in to the restaurants reservation system.

1 star, "Great System", by Cav3, for version 4.2, on Feb 1, 2013
Open Table is a great program. It's easy and simple and how I make 90%of my reservations. For those reviewers who complain their favorite restaurants aren't available you should know that Open Table is a program a restaurant must purchase and pay for. If a restaurant is too cheap or behind the times and doesn't want to make the investment it's not Open Table that is the issue it's the restaurant.

5 stars, "Love it!", by Jeffrey Otto, for version 4.2, on Feb 1, 2013

5 stars, "Great App! And free!", by The 18th Letter, for version 4.2, on Feb 2, 2013
No reason not to have this app. So easy to use, and a lifesaver when searching quickly for a place to eat. Some restaurants require the use of this app. 

For the reviewers who say that this app limits the table reservations that are available: that's not the app. That's the restaurant. Some places only allow the Open Table app to access a limited number of free tables, so that others are available for walk-in customers. 

Regardless, download the app and start using.

5 stars, "One of my very favorite apps", by sailorjohnb, for version 4.2, on Feb 2, 2013
This app is essential to anyone who wants to dine out in places ranging from Washington DC to Healdsburg CA. Much handier than phoning. The reviews are also a useful guide. Some restaurants do not subscribe because the overhead associated with Open Table is not negligible.

This is one of those apps that works better on the iPad than using OpenTable on the Web. I love having all my favorite restaurants pre-set, so that I can look for a last minute reservation availability far faster than I could do it on the phone. OpenTable on the iPhone has also helped me find a good place to eat based on GPS location. Well-designed, easy to use, useful. What more could I ask?

iPad app oddly less usable than iPhone equivalent. We need more options to sift through the thousands of restaurants that might show up, for example, in New York City, when conducting a search. Surprisingly, you can't narrow your search by OpenTable diner ratings. This feels like a very rough first attempt for an iPad app. I hope it improves in the next revision.

A most practical app which makes the whole process of making reservations at a good restaurant so much easier. Be careful, a few restaurants take advantage of the system by still favoring their regular customers through the telephone and use this system to fill whatever empty tables remain.

5 stars, "Great App", by Wendy - Newark, DE, for version 4.2, on Feb 12, 2013
I love this app! I access on multiple devices as well as my PC. It's fast, free, and easy to use. I've been using it for a few years. I love that I can use across the country when on vacation or business. The reviews are often helpful and it makes it simple if you need to change or cancel a reservation. I only wish more restaurants participated. Though I don't write many reviews, I like that I can. Not only do you see what restaurants have times available but you can also visit the websites, view menus, and map the location. This app helped me get reservations at places I never thought I'd get in.

5 stars, "Great for Dining", by stavsmom, for version 4.2, on Feb 12, 2013
Super easy to use for finding and making a reservation for restaurants in your location that are customer rated, give a price frame and are available-- even for last minute reservations.  We have walked into a restaurant hoping to get seated and found the restaurant had no tables for us, or there was a 2 hour wait, walked outside, used open table to find there were tables saved for Open Table, made our own reservation right then, and walked back in to be seated for our reservation!! That's worth 5 stars right there! And, if you make a reservation and need to change/cancel it, it's simple to do. Love the ease of using this!

5 stars, "Fun and easy to use", by Prof1125, for version 4.2, on Feb 12, 2013
I've thought for a long time that Open Table was an excellent way to find a restaurant in an unfamiliar city. The iPad app simply makes it more convenient than it was from a laptop.  I've used the app since it first came out and will continue to do so.

4 stars, "Great App!!", by UpshawFlorida, for version 4.2, on Feb 12, 2013
This app makes it very easy to find a table quickly at some of the best restaurants in Miami. Don't be discouraged if the time you want to dine is unavailable. Just call the restaurant! They can usually move bump the time at least 15 min either way!

4 stars, "A very useful app", by T Slaven, for version 4.2, on Feb 12, 2013

otherwise, the best, most reliable and inclusive restaurant app for NY and many other metro areas

I love the convenience of selecting a restaurant from a map view.  Also seeing a selection of times is very nice.  My suggestion for improvement is making it easier to change the number of guests in the reservation.  The app remembers the last number you used, and if you are ready to book, but the number is wrong, you have to start a new search.  Please provide an easy way to change the number!
--
5 stars, "Outstanding app", by CharlieJLaugh, for version 4.2, on Feb 14, 2013

5 stars, "One of my favorites.", by Not Happy 42, for version 4.2, on Feb 14, 2013
This one of my favorite apps.  I use it frequently to make dinner reservations and to learn about new restaurants.  It is so easy to use, and I think the restaurants take better care of you because they know you may review them after dining with them.   I wish there were more restaurants listed in the areas I use the app.

3 stars, "Functional but needs improvement", by Nitiforu, for version 4.2, on Feb 14, 2013
App does not facilitate filtering by rating, which is important when trying to zero in on top rated restaurants.  Also, the app needs to better accommodate search by restaurant name, without having to go through a convoluted route to get to the "answer".
--
4 stars, "Useful and fast", by Mama Beetle, for version 4.2, on Feb 14, 2013
I've used this app to make several reservations, and it has worked quite well. I generally know the restaurant name and so far have used it to make local reservations only, so I can't vouch for its search capabilities.

3 stars, "Works, but web version is better", by MomApple, for version 4.2, on Feb 15, 2013
I like the fact that it's a reliable app - it doesn't do the "fail to load" thing. What I wish it offered was the same amount of information as the web version. You can't just click on a link to get a menu or go to the restaurants web page. Hence three stars.

4 stars, "Some disappointments", by Marciaackermissall, for version 4.2, on Feb 15, 2013
There were 3 occasions when I was restricted from making reservation on NO special holiday for no explanation at all.
One Maitre d' forgot to post the computer that I was present for the reservation. When I called next day to advise of their oversight I was advised they would attend to confirming I kept the reservation. That never happened to my knowledge.

Once for a restaurant in Delray, a reservation was made and confirmed by Open Table. When I arrived with guests, the restaurant had gone out of business for some time.

Otherwise for a majority of the times I have used this App I have been very pleased.

I have used Open Table for several years, first in San Francisco, then in Massachusetts and later throughout the country.  As the number of restaurants has grown, the service has become more valuable.  Reviews and category ratings are critical.

 Also, site improvements have made it easier to use and more helpful. There have been glitches, such as unexplained cancelations by the service of confirmed reservations -- twice, once in Tennessee, once in Virginia.  Infuriating. Four stars because of that unreliability.

5 stars, "Fantastic App", by cvillasb, for version 4.2, on Feb 23, 2013
Open Table is one of my favourite tools. Here in South West Florida where finding a table during the high season winter months is harder and harder, this app has become indispensable! I only wish EVERY restaurant in town subscribed to this service. It 's their loss not to be part of something that makes customers' lives so much easier! Well done Open Table.

5 stars, "The only way to make a reservation!", by Kkellnr, for version 4.0, on Feb 23, 2013
I've used Open Table since their beta. I can't imagine making reservations or finding a restaurant without it. It's easy to use, a great reference and suggests places if you are in a new place. I also leave special requests for the restaurant to make sure everything is set up ahead of time. Plus, Open Table offers the ability to invite other guests so they know when and where to go.  A great app!

4 stars, "Big improvement, makes it really easy", by Contrari, for version 4.2, on Feb 23, 2013
The iPad app is way superior to the website. It's fast, intuitive and works correctly. I've been a member of Open Table from the beginning and I think it has come into its own with the iPad. Reviews and menus easily accessible. Filters for location, price level and cuisine work well. I'd like it more if Yelp reviews were accessible through this app and if Apple Maps integrated better.I don't like the fact that points expire each year. I had enough to get $20 coupon but my personal situation took me out of the fine dining scene for quite a while. One piece of advice. If the app says a particular time isn't available and you really want that reservation, call the restaurant directly. The maitr d has more flexibility and judgment than an app.

5 stars, "Love it!", by Odile22, for version 4.2, on Feb 24, 2013
My husband and I travel a great deal and use open table to plan our meals before we arrive in a city and even in our home town.  We've had the most amazing meals and service, even special treats from restaurants who appreciate open table reservations.  The map is especially useful when we just want to walk.

5 stars, "Couldn't be easier or more convenient", by Daytongal, for version 4.2, on Feb 25, 2013
OpenTable is the easiest way to make reservations- you can even do it at 3 in the morning!  There is no need to wait for a place to open to call them or hang on the phone waiting your turn.  And if you need to cancel, you can do that in a flash.  How did we get along before without Open Table?

There is no other app out there that can beat "Open Table" when it comes to making reservations.  I have been using this app for as long as it has been active and I love the convenience of finding reservations at some of the best restaurants in the country.  I use it from coast to coast and all of the spots in between. Gray App!!

5 stars, "Great service; great app", by Mark Burris, for version 4.2, on Feb 25, 2013
The manager at our favorite restaurant always asks, "Why don't you just call or email me when you want a reservation?"
Because its neither as convenient nor as certain as booking on the iOS apps, that's why. 

Fast and accurate. In fact, the confirmation email usually arrives in 5 seconds or less.

Can't live without it. Can't understand why all restaurants don't use it. I plan a lot of business dinners that take place during conventions. When you have 10,000 people in a city for a convention, you need to plan 6 months ahead. We have eaten in fabulous restaurants that are impossible to get a reservation, especially when they are for 10-20 people. 

We have a reservation for Elmo's Fire in Indianapolis the end of September. It's in the top 10 restaurants in the US!  Woo hoo!

4 stars, "Great app", by Cpluls, for version 4.2, on Mar 8, 2013
Great app for reserving tables. I have used it in USA and in Europe. Works well and without hitch. Easy to use. The best is the rewards program that gives you money back for doing nothing more than making reservations. I have never shown up in a restaurant and not had my reservation honored.

4 stars, "Great with flaws", by Redcat22, for version 4.0, on Mar 9, 2013
Always use the app and am very satisfied. . .BUT, living in Manhattan, it's a pain when I first open it and it wants to search for a restaurant in my area.  A little annoying to wait for it to load thousands of restaurants before I can use a filter search.  This can be particularly annoying when I'm not at home or some where with wi-fi.

If you're trying to go to a popular restaurant, it's impossible to find the next time a table is free. Even if you find a table, it's hard to see all the options, i.e., if you want to see if you can go a little later

Have used on many occasions when traveling and trying to find appropriate places depending on the group.   Some venues still have 'system issues' processing .... Have arrived a few times and they have not had our reservation, but this is an exception.  Overall great.  Like that it connects directly from other travel assist app's.

I always book with Open Table. We have become so spoiled with the convenience of a reservation we hardly eat out without one. It allows you to communicate special requests with you reservation like special tables or occasions. The links within the app for restaurant specifics, menus, restaurant reviews etc., etc., are most helpful. It's a great app for when you are on the road traveling to cities you are unfamiliar with. The email invite feature sends your dinner date all the details for your night out on the town. Can't say enough good things about it!

This app is not quite as easy to navigate as the website.  In some ways it is easier withe map, but marking your location is not as easy as it should be.  It seems to work best when you know the name of the neighborhood and those are easier to find.  Sometimes restaurant that shoe on the website seem to not show on the app unless you put the exact name in.

I use this app all the time In many cities with great success. Occasionally, I worry that I have been given a less desirable table by booking through Open Table rather than calling, but it is difficult to prove this. In any case, this is not the app's fault, and I found without exception that my table is ready when booked. Booking tables is dead easy with the app, and it is useful to get a confirmation reminder both upon booking and a day or so before the reservation. I have found the reviews to be helpful and fairly accurate. Altogether a vey useful tool for finding and booking restaurant tables!

1 star, "My first one-star review. Ever.", by groupeone, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 16, 2013
Grrrr. I just tried to make a reservation with ClosedTable. It's a app I've used for years. Once upon a time, OpenTable was easy to use. Then, they "fixed" it. 

First, their system rejected my password, but there is no place to re-set it. Second, when I tried making a reservation as a guest, I got all the way through and at the end was - you guessed it - rejected. Try entering your phone number with dashes or and area code in parenthesis - it barks at you. My wife then tried to get the same reservation with her login and was - get ready - rejected. And on and on.

OpenTable has been taken over by IT Nazis. It's a once wonderful app and system riddled with bugs. Now I know where the programmers of Windows Vista went to work. 

Fix this!

4 stars, "Must have", by WF foodie, for version 4.2, on Mar 18, 2013
A must have for finding a great dinner out.  Like that it will filter searches down to specific parts of town so I'm only looking at restaurants around where I'm going to be.  Use it almost for every dinner reservation. Wish more restaurants were on board

4 stars, "Excellent for most dining experiences", by Thomas Reynolds, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 18, 2013
I've been using this for a few years, and find it essential for finding good restaurants when i travel, and for easily - from phone, iPad, or computer - making or changing reservations. I really appreciate the reviews, and write about most of the restaurants i book - because they give you a good flavor about the service, what might be really good at the moment, or turn-offs. A really good app and service.

I use OT all the time.  It is very easy to use and makes making reservations a snap :). The only reason I don't give it five stars is because sometimes if I'm not logged in when I go to make a reservation, it will ask me to login but once I do it will say the time I wanted is no longer available when it actually is.  In order to get around this I have to perform my search all over again and then it will allow me to make the reservation.

3 stars, "Needs better, more specific filters", by Playgoer, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 22, 2013
I use Open Table a lot, but find it very time consuming because in order to find the address of a restaurant, you have to click through to the listing.  The "neighborhood" filter is too broad. I would love to be able to enter the cross streets I'm looking for and have restaurants that are nearby shown on a map similar to the Best Parking app.

We love this app and use it religiously. It's our go-to app for dinner reservations on the weekend. My only request is that it becomes a little more intuitive in future releases. The navigation is a little odd at times. I think the favorites section should not be hidden and I would like it if the app would make recommendations based on past selections. I would also like it if it displayed most recent restaurant visited. Regardless of these requests we love how easy and convenient making dinner reservations has become. If it's not on open table we don't go.

4 stars, "good, could be great", by Mary Schuble, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 23, 2013
would love to see more (all) choices in my local area, but understand this is hard/unreasonable. Good to know some of my now favorites came out of using OpenTable - convenience has a lot to do with that. Sometimes a bit glitchy though, will say there's no open tables available nearby and then when double check later and shows tables and times galore.

I travel every week all around the country and Open Table has become a cornerstone of my dinner plans.  It usually finds me a place close to where I may be in a given city and meaningful reviews to help decide whether to go to an establishment.  If there is any shortcoming it is that in some cities, not enough places are in the Open Table system.  Hopefully those places that are not on board will figure out that a TON of folks rely on this app and they are missing their business.

4 stars, "It Could Be 5 Stars but....", by Sexy NJ, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 27, 2013
I live in NJ and sometimes I want to meet my friends for dinner at a place between us. New Jersey, as small as we are, have a lot of great restaurants but only having the option to "use current location" or Philadelphia or New York doesn't help. I want to be able to put a city in and then pick a radius. I do see that once in Central NJ I did the "use current location" option so now that is listed in my recent searches. But there are places south of New Brunswick but north of Cherry Hill that I'm completely not able to search for (unless I know the name of the place, which defeats my purpose of the app which is to discover new great places). Other than that, I really love this app. I eat out a lot and travel a lot so it's great (outside all above mentioned comments lol). Make that change and this is 5 stars all the way.

5 stars, "Open Table keeps getting better and better", by Casadesonoma, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 29, 2013
We live in Sonoma where food and wine are king, and we travel extensively. Open Table is like having a personal concierge. I just came home and asked my wife if she'd like to go to one of our favortie Sonoma restaurants, Carnero's Bistro, I opened my iPad, tapped on the APP, scanned the times available for a table for two and was done in 3 minutes.
   When we travel we not only see the reviews we used to turn to Zagats for, we can sort local restaurants by type, by availability, by distance from our hotel or our current location, as long as we allow the application to know where we are. We know the price range, the menu and what other diners liked or disliked about each restaurant. And, we earn points doing it. It's win-win for us and for the restaurant, and we believe that apps like this encourage restaurants to improve their offering to be competitive. Highly recommended

Open Table is a very handy app. Whenever I'm traveling, I typically use Open Table for dinner reservations. It's quick, real time, and effective. I have yet to have a reservation mix up with Open Table. Some restaurants aren't hooked up with it yet, but enough are to provide good coverage, especially in metro areas.

This app and service is the best. We had to make arrangements for a post funeral brunch involving 20 people in a different state. After entering the desired time and number of people and location it simply listed the restaurants available at the time we needed. We clicked on a restaurant we knew of and we were done. Made our lives really simple.

3 stars, "Mobile app difficulties", by 1000 pt issues, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 30, 2013
Changing location to a specific city on the mobile app does not seem possible. If you are using one of their major metro areas everything works fine. Also be ware when booking 1000 point dining times. You must do this from the 1000 point list or else you do not get the 1000 points only 100. Not sure where this is explained but that is what their email stated to me.

1 star, "Clearly in the reviewer minority, but I think this app is poorly designed", by kkastle, for version 4.4.1, on Apr 1, 2013
Don't like the lack of navigation and embedded assumptions it makes when opening the app.  I don't remember being locked in by location on previous versions. 

Either way, I find it cumbersome to look for restaurants in locations other than my current one &amp; I don't like not having a landing page that more intuitively/obviously allows for all search options (by restaurant name, location, type, prior reservation, etc) in beginning a search.

We wouldn't leave home without the iPad and would't use an iPad without Open Table.

I love my OpenTable iPhone and iPad apps. It is an easy way to make lunch and dinner reservations at my favorite places, for both business and fun.

5 stars, "One of my favorites apps", by San325, for version 4.4.1, on Apr 9, 2013
This is a great app. You just open it and it gives you a list of what's available for restaurant reservations in your area immediately. You can have a reservation made in minutes. There have been times where I was in the parking lot and made a reservation and went inside and got seated. It doesn't have every single restaurant and may not be very useful in rural areas, but when in big cities and especially while traveling it's fantastic for finding place to go and get a reservation made all in one shot.

5 stars, "Can't Do Without It!!!", by Dbern2731, for version 4.5.0, on Apr 12, 2013
I travel quite a bit. When you come into a new city, you don't know the surroundings and you depend on recommendations from other travelers, hotel staff or your gut as you drive around. Usually very disappointing!

I've been a member of Open Table for years and it has never let me down. Ratings are always dead on!

I couldn't be without it!

I've been using this app for several years now, and it has continued to improve.  Ease of use now is terrific.  Generally less than a minute to make or change a reservation, even if you don't know where you want to go when you start.  When I go to a restaurant that isn't on the system, I tell them they should be, because they will lose business to convenience.

This is a terrific app!  I'd known about it for a long time because of my daughter the foodie, but never got around to using it. I finally got a chance to put it to the test when my wife and I went to Charleston for a week.  We had a handful of restaurants to try but I never realized how important it was to book well in advance.

5 stars, "The Best", by Jim & Bob NYC, for version 4.5.0, on Apr 20, 2013
I have really appreciated OpenTable, both the classic browser version and the iPad app for a while now. But I must say the latest redesign of the iPad app is gorgeous, clean and so very easy to navigate. Perfect. 

Every time I open the app and make a quick reservation wherever I happen to be I feel so Jetsonian. You have revolutionized the process of making dinner reservations.

4 stars, "Pretty good system", by JDA111, for version 4.2, on Apr 21, 2013
I generally see open table as a great benefit, and always endorse it to friends.  But it is not without it's quirks, which are annoying for such an otherwise thoughtful system.  Improvements could include the ability to further pinpoint areas where you wish to dine. I live in northern jersey, and haven't figured out a way to pick a town several miles away where I might be going to a concert one night or visiting friends.  Instead you must work out in a geographical radius,which takes a lot of time.  By contrast, yelp allows you to use a map to pick out your area.
 The most annoying item is when system does not work.  You pick a time and place, hit reserve, and it says nothing available within  2.5 hours of your time.  This has happened many times, and I now know to call the restaurant to get a table, which most often is available. I don't know why this happens, but guess no system is perfect..  Btw, open table, how about listing the phone number to make it easier to call when that happens?

It is convenient to use for making reservations for restaurants I already know in my city, and it is a good way to find out about new restaurants.

I highly recommend Open Table to anyone who loves to dine out in great restaurants.

5 stars, "why not?", by Magnificentfun, for version 4.5.0, on Apr 27, 2013
I have no idea why anyone would NOT use this app. I now have used it in Laguna Beach, California, Washington, DC, Boston, and elsewhere. It helps identify a good restaurant when you are visiting a town, and guarantees a spot at your favorite place near home. I now have used this for several months, and it has only improved my experience of going out to eat. I don't get into the whole points thing, although I probably should. But it definitely is a useful tool, and at least so far, I see no downside at all to using it, except perhaps there will be less room at participating restaurants for spontaneous non-planners-ahead.

3 stars, "Too much info?", by Ali63, for version 4.5.0, on Apr 30, 2013
Suddenly the app gives so many options that it has become almost useless... I live in MD just outside DC, and it now offers restaurants within about a 75- mile radius, BUT it is excluding restaurants in northern VA, just 10 miles away.

We love this app. With it, we are "in the know" before we go. So far, we have not had to wait for a table when we have reserved with Open Table. We use it to explore new local restaurants, and especially to find dependable choices of restaurants and local hot spots when traveling. We also use restaurant reviews to know which dishes are especially popular at restaurants we are choosing. We feel Open Table really gives us the inside track.

I use Open Table all the times for my dining reservations!  I can't imagine life without it.  It has the menus and the links to the restaurants' websites.  All in all, it is very helpful and useful. However, I wish that they would provide some kind of rating like Zagat or Yelp.  Also, there are often limitations for booking for large parties.

This is a great tool for making reservations, for lunch, dinner, last minute or way in advance!  It is so easy to use and the most convenient way I can think of to make reservations.  Not only does it make life easier but by using Open Table we have found a number of new restaurants to try that have now become some of our favorites.  Being able to use the iPad or iPhone  means I can make a reservation anywhere, anytime!  Thank you Open Table.

I rely on Open Table when I travel, and for special occasions when at home. The iPad app is efficient, reliable, and works really well. I love reading  the restaurant reviews and often base my decisions on them. Being able to review a menu beforehand is a huge plus albeit I do sometimes find that the restaurants do not keep this up to date.

All told, this is one of the most useful apps for people who dine out often.

But many high-quality restaurants are available on Open Table, and the reviews are rather trustworthy.  The app itself is very easy to use and doesn't require much of the user.  Never had any bugs either!  Enjoy!

Since discovering Open Table, I rarely go to a restaurant without first consulting with it for reviews. Even on the go or when making spur of the moment plans, its so quick and easy finding restaurants with openings, filtered by the price and location you desire. The best thing is you no longer have to show up and wait until a table opens up because you just simply find it on this great app.

This app is a must-have. My husband and I just decided to eat out tonight. We're in the bathroom getting dressed for work at 6:15 AM. I picked up my iPad, and we have dinner reservations without having to figure out when someone will be at the restaurant to get our call. This totally works for busy lives. Even if it's spur of the moment at dinner time, you can use the app to see what tables are available at what restaurants at what time and book a table faster than a phone call. I can't figure out what's not to like here.

4 stars, "Convenient, Quick, slick UI", by DZ Sands, for version 4.5.0, on May 10, 2013
This is a great app, which enables quick and easy restaurant reservations while providing a nice user experience. Obviously it's limitation is the restaurants in the OpenTable network, but that network is quite broad.

My only gripe is that there is no way to search for restaurants close to a particular city or zip code. For example, I work in Boston and want to search for a reservation near my home, in a suburb west of Boston. My only options are to search near me (not useful) or to search in the broad category of "Boston Suburbs," many of which are nowhere near my home.

Fix that and you get 5 stars.

Whether at home or away when traveling for business OpenTable is the ONLY app I use to find restaurants.  Very easy to use, great mapping technology and super easy to use.  And I love that the App works equally well on my Blackberry as one would expect it to work on my iPad.

I consider it a MUST HAVE App for anyone who an active diner, especially if you travel for work and need valid recommendations in major (and some not so major) cities that feature OpenTable Restaurants.

Requesting a credit check for your dining loyalty is easy and the check arrives within a week to 10 days.

5 stars, "Terrific app for reservations", by Sherrie S, for version 4.5.0, on May 11, 2013
I love using OpenTable. It's so fast to find when reservations are available, modify or cancel. When we're traveling, it's easy to find excellent restaurants, and earning points is a wonderful bonus.

1 star, "Much less features than the explorer version", by Ghin868, for version 4.5.0, on May 12, 2013
I dont like too much this app as it has much less features than the ie explorer version. What is the point to go Mobile if you cannot do everything you normally do on a none mobile computer.

3 stars, "Good app, poor customer service", by taylordavidson, for version 4.5.0, on May 14, 2013
The app is easy to use and is great for finding a reservation. I use it a lot, but never received a dining certificate after I had earned a lot of points. Open table is impossible to contact if things like that go wrong. Good app, poor customer service.

4 stars, "Personal concierge", by carolineantonio, for version 4.2, on May 14, 2013
Use this all the time for where to eat. Can find reviews, menu
Availability, anywhere, have not been to a bad open table restaurant. Plus you get points eating at your fav places.
Use it often.

1 star, "Not 5 stars in comparison with past versions", by Colocanuk, for version 4.5.0, on May 15, 2013
Not enough space is provided, either in portrait or landscape mode, to read menus, without moving them back and forth.

Secondly, you took away our ability to view and edit our account information, and to view accumulated points.

This is an improvement?

I USE "OPEN TABLE" FOR ALMOST ALL OF MY RESTAURANT  RESERVATIONS.  IT IS SO EASY AND FAST. AND ALSO MOST RELIABLE.

DO NOT KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD NOT USE IT.

KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!

4 stars, "Great for checking wait time", by Tampa-Jay, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 22, 2013
This app is great for getting an idea of what's available last minute before heading out the door - Although I wish they had more restaurants and sometimes it will say no times available for the selection, but when you call they can get you in - Still would recommend for anyone who likes to plan there evening and hates holding on the phone for someone to take your reservation

1 star, "Bugs Galore", by Ron Kirch, for version 4.4.1, on Apr 9, 2013
Used to love it on the Itouch.  Could see restaurant names and locations.  Got an IPad and the names run off the side making it really tough when there is multiple locations for a restaurant.  Interesting that there is more real estate on the IPAD.  Still used it even though poorly designed.  

But now the current version is unusable, says my Email is not valid when Reserving as a guest.  I really see no need to become a member.  So now I have to go to the web version or by pass and go to the restaurants website.

No Good...........
