Hasta la ultima actualización funcionaba perfectamente, después se corta en el proceso de reserva y no sirve de nada, hay que ir a opentable.com, su aplicación es inútil, escribí a atención a clientes y me dijeron que yo era el único que se quejaba, esta claro que les sucede a todos.  
Ojalá resuelvan el problema con una actualización.

Sigue mal, no hacen caso, no pierdan tiempo, no la bajen es una porquería.

Sigue sin servir, ya mandé una queja a los desarrolladores y no me creen, siguen diciendo que solo me pasa a mi.
Estos gringos son tan cerrados que parecen tontos.

5 stars, "Excellent if restaurants use the system", by Spiiike, for version 2.0.1, on 29-Nov-2009
Opentable is a booking system for restaurants. Restaurants have to sign up and use the system for their bookings to appear either on the website or iPhone app. It's quite expensive to use the system because it involves both hardware and software. This is why it is more the high end restaurants that appear - they can afford it and see the advantages of realtime booking on the Internet. A very well made app that works. If you local/favourite restaurant doesn't appear why not tell them?

5 stars, "High end app", by Galliano2001, for version 2.0.1, on 07-Jan-2010
The app store rating system is ruined by morons who don't understand what they are rating. It's a free app that requires restaurants to sign up, don't blame the app because your local harvester in Yorkshire is not signed up.

3 stars, "Works very well as far as it goes", by dominic123, for version 1.0.1, on 27-Nov-2008
Beautifully built app t find nearest restaurants, get details and book tables. But: 
-No reviews, just the blurb from the restaurant itself
-Very fiddly to go direct to the list of restaurants
Frankly, there are so many restaurants in central London that the location feature is less useful that it might be somewhere else. And with no reviews, you're dependent on reputation - have you heard that a place is good? If so you can just do a google maps lookup and call them...

Still this is the second decent UK restaurant app on the store after Urban Spoon, and in many ways its better...

1 star, "Disasterous App if you're in London", by dactylos, for version 3.2, on 29-Dec-2010

3 stars, "Not bad but some annoyances...", by Greg Beech, for version 2.0.1, on 08-Oct-2009
...the worst of which being that it simply doesn't save my login email and password so every time I want to check a booking or get walking directions to one I have to type it in again. Aargh. Fix this and I'd increase the rating straight away.

It would also be nice to be able to access and leave reviews.

1 star, "Suspiciously awful", by Jay2-o, for version 2.0.1, on 11-Oct-2009
There are dozens of great restaurants within 10 miles of where I live but this rubbish app only offered one distictly average Indian. Makes me wonder if the listed places have paid for the privilege.  Don't waste time dowloading. Look at something like Onion Ring and then pick up the phone to book.

2 stars, "Open Table", by Turbo AT900C, for version 2.0.1, on 25-Oct-2009
Probably great in America. Nothing like enough restaurants included in the UK. Goodness knows where they get their database from. I get four or five options and some are even close by. I know of 20 plus in the area searched half of which are very good at what they do. If I knew the ones in the area covered by the app search then I am sure it would be in the hundreds (not four!). Interface is excellent but data is useless.

A useful app that lets you use your local position and then locates resturants with free tables for the number of persons specified. A summary is given and you can then proceed to book the table from within the app at the fixed times displayed. Information on parking, reviews, example menu (web page) is provided. I have not tried the booking, but this appeals to the lazy side of me, having to avoid calling the resturant to book!
--
5 stars, "A great app", by Groomus, for version 3.0.2, on 25-Apr-2010
A great app. Does what is says on the tin! Perhaps the option to write a review on the restaurant using the iphone after your booking would help.

4 stars, "Takes hassle out of finding somewhere for dinner", by Tolleysophie, for version 3.5, on 25-Feb-2012
Very useful- you tell it a time and location, type of food etc and it tells you where you can eat, takes the hassle away as you no longer pend ages choosing a restaurant only to find it is rally booked. One gripe, when you switch out of the app to look at a review it puts ou back to the start page a great upgrade would be for it to remember the search results.

Quite simple to use improvements need to be made to the contact details sent to the restaurant for example uk mobile numbers can't be entered for bookings in US even when country code entered, won't let you proceed unless you have a local number which I don't. Easy search facility and good to use search by current location etc

3 stars, "Useful but annoying", by Trantor58, for version 3.0.2, on Mar 19, 2010
Why does this app make me continually re-enter my phone number and email address?  Why should I have the chance of entering a digit wrong every time I make a reservation?  If that kind of annoyance were fixed it would be a lot easier to use.

5 stars, "Impressive", by ditec, for version 2.0.1, on Nov 15, 2009
At NY NY in Las Vegas, a friend called to make a reservation at Gallaghers Steak House. He was told they were booked. I remembered that I had downloaded OpenTable and thought I would try to find another place. Gallaghers came up and OpenTable found us a table for six at Gallaghers and made the reservation for us. This review is for this one time use and it was great.

1 star, "Worthless App", by Molto Disappointed, for version 3.2, on Jan 2, 2011
Latest update is a significant downgrade. If you like the app don't upgrade. The search function  no longer works.  It takes far less time to just call the restaurant.  App not even worth using. The app is useless for a traveler. If you want or need reviews go to Yelp. If your a traveler who knows where they want to eat and just needs a reservation save time and aggravation just call the restaurant. It is too bad this app used to be better.

Please respect your customers. Leave for google to do ads, and you do reservations.

5 stars, "Finally!", by DM Dogcow, for version 3.0.4, on Jul 13, 2010
v3.0.4 works again!!!

This app is NOT Urbanspoon or Yelp! If you want to complain about the lack of participating restaurants then you obviously don't understand this app's purpose. Rate the app, not OT's ability to sign up restaurants in your hometown.

It is obviously not as powerful as the regular website, but it's better than OT's mobile web page. The integration of the iPhone's GPS with OT's "find near me" seals the deal. It's not often that I know the name of the neighborhood where I am in a strange city... now it doesn't matter. And I really like the map function!

2 stars, "I hate this app", by Redmelody177, for version 3.2, on Jan 2, 2011

5 stars, "If you eat out a couple times per month or more then GET THIS APP!!!!", by HGH, for version 3.0.2, on Mar 30, 2010
That's right... this app is wonderful!  I consider myself a fairly reserved reviewer, not given to effusive praise.  This review is no exception.  This simple app is simply excellent - if you'll forgive the pun.  We eat out at least once or twice per week.  We've been using this app for the past several weeks and we've found it to be infinitely more useful than calling around to different restaurants and seeing what reservations are available.  It's also great to know we are accumulating "points" to be used toward gift cards.  That's always a pleasant bonus.  The app is quite easy to use and most of the issues others seem to be mentioning have, as far as I can tell, been resolved.  The abilities to look at menus or receive directions right within the app are very nice additions.  Frankly, I would have no reservations (again, pardon the pun) paying for this app so to be able to get it for free is simply fantastic!  I would normally worry about coming ads to subsidize the developers' expenses.  However, given this is mainly an adjunct to the main software sold to restaurants (and presuming the developers' succumb not to greed) the likelihood of seeing ads anytime in the foreseeable future ought to remain quite low.  After all, this app being a significant selling point of the main program sold to restauants, it simply wouldn't do to drive away a potentially large segment of users just in the name of generating some ad revenue.

Try it!  We think you'll agree it takes the toil out of weekend dining arrangements.

3 stars, "Wonderful service but the App needs serious improvements", by GizmoGal, for version 2.0.1, on Nov 16, 2009
As a frequent Open Table customer, I can say that the concept and execution on a computer is terrific and soon becomes indispensable. However, the App version is a stripped down program with numerous web features missing. It is difficult to sort by restaurant name and neighborhood which is most important when you are on the move. The iPhone automatically locates your general area, but this is not precise enough for the daily user who may be visiting another part of town later in the evening. OT is a wonderful service, and I will look forward to speedy improvements to the App in the coming months.

5 stars, "Best of it's kind.", by AppleBoy947, for version 3.3.1, on May 23, 2011
OpenTable is by far the best app when it comes to eating out.  Every stinkin' restaurant shows up on that app, and it has detailed info on all of them!  The reservation features and search refining makes this app a joy and ease to use.  I highly recommend OpenTable for all your restaurant needs!

4 stars, "The Best Reservation Service on the Best Platform!", by iByron, for version 1.0, on Nov 18, 2008
Version 1.0 - Finally, iPhone users have a dedicated app for the most popular reservation service on the web. The user can reserve tables at any of the continuously growing list of over 8,500 restaurants with no hassle. Better still, if you sign up for a free account, you can earn Dining Rewards points that can be redeemed for Dining Cheques that are good at any OpenTable restaurant. 2,000 points gets you a $20 (US) check. Most reservations are 100 points, but some locations and times can earn 1,000. Eat out twice and get $20!

You can enter and save your account information, which allows you to see your points balance and current and recent reservations. OpenTable adds a new feature unique to the iPhone: a "Current Location" search that finds restaurants with open tables near you. The app is missing a few useful features that are available on the OT website (thus only four stars). You can't search directly for a restaurant by name, or browse by cuisine, special features (BYOB, good for groups), "Best of" list, or (oddly enough) by bonus point availability. Hopefully they'll appear in a future version. 

BTW, OpenTable listens to their users. Write them directly with any useful idea and you'll likely see it implemented. Great app, great company!

1 star, "Major flaw.", by Desert_Photos, for version 2.0.1, on Oct 4, 2009
You can't search by type of cuisine. OK, suppose I'm in Boulder, CO, on business, and I want Italian food for dinner. I can't search for Italian food on Open Table. The Yellow Pages in my hotel room would be more helpful. That's why I'm only giving this App 1 star.

4 stars, "More convenient than the OpenTable website", by Pixel Hunter, for version 3.0.2, on Apr 14, 2010
OpenTable is a reservation making system that some restaurants participate in. Mostly mid- to upper-price restaurants in metro areas. If you already use OpenTable, or live in an area with restaurants you visit covered, then get this app.

This app allows you to make reservations anywhere, even if there is no computer available. The app is much easier to use than the mobile website. I have not had any problems using the app, and haven't been required to enter all my information after the first time. The one feature I wish the OpenTable app had was the ability to add your reservation to your iPhone Calendar app once made.

3 stars, "Nice, BUT", by Browser54 at Mac dot com, for version 2.0.1, on Oct 8, 2009
Useful app but needs an update to address the following:

Does not retain login credentials despite clicking on save login info.  Very annoying having to reenter login info every time you want to make reservations, especially from your car.

Needs a link to save restaurant info to contact list.  Come on, it's an iPhone app.  This should have been included in the first release.

Open Table emailed me asking for a review of my dining experience, which I was happy to provide for the benefit of future diners.  That was over 2 weeks ago, and my review has still not appeared in the restaurant's review list.  Need to update the reviews faster or provide a link within the app to upload reviews.

Despite having a 7:30 reservation, we were not seated until 8:15 at one of Open Table restaurants.  Restaurants who participate in the Open Table program should be expected to seat Open Table diners within 15 minutes or withdraw from the program.  If at 7:15 they know they won't be able to seat you until 8:15 then don't post that a table is available at 7:30.  Participating restaurants should be required to update actual availability or accommodate reservations they confirm.

3 stars, "Great service, iPhone app needs work", by indiebit, for version 3.1.1, on Nov 12, 2010
The Open Table service is great.  It's been very useful.

The iPhone app is centered around "where you are".  That's great if you're looking in that area but if you're going to drive somewhere that's not a major city you can't put in the destination location and ask to find restaurants near there.  Add an option to the search functionality that lets you specify a target city/state or zip code and this app will be much more useful.  The entire world doesn't revolve around major cities.

2 stars, "Awesomely Annoying", by Don Filicetti, for version 3.1.1, on Nov 4, 2010
I love this App in theory but it has been screwed up for months.  I just downloaded the newest version hoping it was fixed and I still have the same issue I've been having for months.  I log in and the first thing I notice is that it says "null" "null" at the top of a specific reservation.  I then attempt to modify a specific reservation but the space that should contain the date and time is blank.  When I try to hit the "modify" button, the app crashes and shuts down.  End of story.  What the heck is going on?  I can book restaurants etc without issue and I love the service. I use it ALL the time and have amassed a lot of points.  I even bought the stock; that's how much I believe in the company. Why can't they get this App to stop being flaky and just work??? Very frustrating!!!

5 stars, "Get it now", by Mcv33, for version 1.0.1, on Nov 23, 2008
The first time I used this was last Friday night at a place that requires reservations days in advance in West Palm Beach. By the time we took the elevator down from my friends condo to the street, we were confirmed for our party of 6 to be seated in 20 mins! We were sat immediately upon arrival. This alone earned my 5 stars...will use it every chance I can from now on.

3 stars, "Adequate", by robwest, for version 2.0, on Aug 22, 2009
But a couple of points I feel would bring this to 4 or 5 stars. 1) remember me, as the app always asks me to confirm my login. 2) search by restaurant without having to go thru the whole rigamarole. 3) 1000 point table search. 

Otherwise, a near-faithful companion to the website.

2 stars, "Interface is frustrating", by Kamakazie, for version 3.2, on Jan 7, 2011
I like the idea, glad they have an app but the interface design is maddending, for example the search by restaurant name on the bottom of the screen, so you click there and guess what it's not a search field it jumps you to another screen with multiple search fields, not intutitve. Also if they don't have the restaurant in their service (which seems to be all the places I want to go to), it's not clear I find myself redoing my search because i thought I did somethign wrong. Anyways great idea and if they add more restaurants will be very useful but the interface needs some thought to make it intuitive.

5 stars, "Excellent iteration of an already-great service", by mikey_a, for version 1.0, on Nov 20, 2008
Opentable.com has long been a great tool for booking restaurants. Particularly  in large cities with many participating locations, it greatly reduces hassles in making reservations by presenting one's options in an easily viewable and actionable way. Any time day or night, it lets you find what you need when you need it. 

This iphone version carries over a lot of the normal online experience and adds good new funcionality with the location services of the phone. For the first release version of the app, it sure seems like they put good thougt into making it much, much easier to use and navigate (as opposed to their "mobile" web version, which was feature-poor and hard to maneuver). 

Way to go!

I'm a long time OpenTable user and would love to extend my use to the iPhone.  The app really needs to add the ability to search by cuisine, but more importantly to search by restaurants within 1, 5, 10, 20 miles.  This would make it far more useful to the business traveler who is unfamiliar with the neighborhoods in the area…  Finally being able to sort or filter by restaurant expense would be a big help for when I'm making a reservation for dinner with a fellow employee or with a big customer.

LOVE having OpenTable on my iPhone. Used to go through the mobile site, but this is better. 

BUT: I miss being able to find out more about the restaurants, the map needs to work well (got a map of France for a restaurant in Mexico City) -maybe even include direct links to the maps app. I would also appreciate being able to get more info on restaurants, cuisines (this is a critique of the whole OT service),  and of course needs to be stabler and not "hang" for hours in the middle of a search. Update and will take to five stars.

OpenTable is one of my favorite services. Period. Kudos for bringing it closer to me.

1 star, "Painful to use", by Gourmet54321, for version 3.4.2, on Dec 10, 2011
I use this app a lot but every time it's painful since the user interface lacks all the comfort of the website as already mentioned by so many people here. When will they fix that?

5 stars, "Great Convenience", by Sparkmaster45, for version 3.6, on Mar 10, 2012
If you enjoy dining out at fine restaurants, you should have this app. It covers many fine places to dine and is easy and convenient to use. Informative and better than reservations by phone.

4 stars, "Just what you need", by rovingdan, for version 1.0, on Nov 15, 2008
We often rush home from the kids activites and decide to get cleaned up and go out for a nice meal. This is great for finding a good restaurant and making a quick reservation on the way home. 

It's fast, finds all the good restaurants and books it with a few clicks. 

I've used opentable before online and this takes full advantage of the account.  It remembers all the past bookings so it's easy to rebook. 

Well worth it 

Of course it would be nice if the map was linked google maps so you could plot a course and zoom in and out.

4 stars, "Great app", by jbessey, for version 1.0, on Nov 18, 2008
This will come in very handy. A couple of improvements are needed though: a way to quickly search for a specific restaurant as well as a more functional map interface including the ability to zoom.

4 stars, "Great! One suggestion", by hollismb, for version 1.0.1, on Nov 24, 2008
I'm so glad this app exists, since I've always used the website to make reservations. My suggestion would be to let me search on reservations and view the restaurant info from the profile page, which would make it easy to make reservations at places I've already been from my history.

1 star, "Website is much-much better....", by Honeybeezz, for version 2.0.1, on Oct 6, 2009
I have a suggestion for your iPhone application: how about the ability to access the additional dinners names we have setup in our accounts?  As an Executive Assistant most of the reservations i make are for my bosses; so if i am making a res for one of them i can't because it uses the default account name - mine. Kind of defeats the purpose of inputting names in the website if you can't even access them on the iPhone application.  I may as well delete this from my iphone if every time I have to make a reservation for someone else I have to do it from the browser so I can select a name - no?  Very disappointed!!!!

4 stars, "Thanks!", by Posh Penguin, for version 1.0.1, on Nov 25, 2008
I love OpenTable and always use the website on my iPhone. Thanks for making this app. It works really well (read story below). Minus one star because I would like to see a "My Favorites" list and a "People who ate at this restaurant also tried..." list. Also would like to see it tied to Google maps. If you don't use this app I highly recommend their website for making reservations.

Story: I was in Vegas and a restaurant did not let my girlfriend in bc she had on sandals. I pulled up OpenTable on my iPhone and made reservations to one of Emeril's restaurants. Our table was ready within the 15 minutes it took us to walk over there.

2 stars, "No Restaurant Searching!", by Chevalier du Tastevin, for version 1.1.3, on Jul 14, 2009
It is really bizaare that you can't select a restaurant by name and see if there is a table available, like the online version. You have to enter a location, date, time, and seat count. Then it returns a list of all restaurants in the area with tables available, but not necessarily the restaurant you want to dine at. You can then search the long list for the restaurant you want. With popular restaurants this is very tedious as the restaurant won't be listed if there are no seats. You have to search over and over again, each time trying another date/time hoping that your restaurant will be in the list. The online version allows you to enter a restaurant by name. If it is booked, OpenTable offers alternate times. This is a poorly realized app, very tedious to use. The only useful feature is finding restaurants near your present location, by GPS. Great if you're in a new city and don't care where you'll eat. Tedious and frustrating though if you know where you want to eat. You're better off calling the restaurant than using this app.

4 stars, "Add Favorite Restaurants Option!!!!!", by dallas75205, for version 2.0, on Aug 12, 2009
You all STILL need to add a way for users to keep a list of favorites. This should be a pretty easy thing to do. You state that we can go back to restaurants from our list of recent visits BUT you actually don't list them all - therefore this is not as good as being able to keep a list of FAVORITES. Please make this happen!!!

2 stars, "Works fine, but all available times not shown!", by dna dan, for version 2.0, on Sep 5, 2009
This application works just fine for making, adjusting, canceling reservations... HOWEVER, it does not show all the available reservation times. Example: Would not let me book within two hours of my desired reservation time, but calling the restaurant over the phone, they were open for reservations at any time, and the restaurant was half empty. This has happened two out of four times I have used this application to make reservations. It is probably easier just to call.

2 stars, "Fair for what it is...", by amkaplan, for version 3.4, on Oct 6, 2011
If this had a better system for finding a location, it would be infinitely better.  The neighborhoods are too broad.  There is no was to input an address as a search referent.   There is no search for a specific restaurant.  Map availability (like on the website) is only available when using the restaurants near me/GPS option, so I can't make a reservation for another city or area easily.

Not well thought out, considering it is not a new app.

This has been a good app, and it is very handy for the most part. I have two recommendations for the mobile app. 
1. Make the restaurant phone number available. It would be handy when running late for reservations.
2. Have the restaurant review available on the mobile app. I'm more apt to review something during, or right after the experience.
Other then that, it's a great app. Thanks!

Last year I had to do a LOT of traveling for business and found myself in both metropolitan and small southern towns. As with most people, I can love the southern theme like the best of them, but when it comes to food - you can only handle so much 'Paula Dean'-type choices. When I used this app, I was able to locate places the locals did not know existed, like an upscale Asian restaurant, with a jazz trio, in Cary, NC. Who knew!! This app is a must have when you are on the road, and a really good asset when you are at home, too.

In Charleston, SC and there was a place we really want to eat at. We went to the restaurant and were told they had no open tables. As we start to leave I thought about Open Table and decide to see what was around and available. To my surprise the place we wanted to eat at was showing open slots. I decide to take one and turn around an told the host I did have a reservations and give me a funny look and check and said I see it right here.   

Great application.

I was thrilled to see one of my favorite web services come to my iPhone, but this is a very basic interface to the hugely powerful Open Table.

The way this app is laid out is certainly not how I think when I'm looking for a restaurant. 

First, I would like By Cuisine to be promoted to a spot near By Neighborhood, instead of being hidden under Refine. 

Second, when I just want to go someplace I know is good, have it search directly within my Favorites list, perhaps ordering them by proximity to my current location.

Both of these just seemed so obvious to me that their absence leaves me disappointed.

It doesn't remember anything- even if you just swap over to your email and back, it starts at the beginning. It doesn't autofill, so you have to type whole city names in to search. Just extremely limited. 

If you open the app knowing exactly which restaurant you want to make a reservation for, and do it straight away, I suppose it works well enough.

2 stars, "No direct search?", by stat0matic, for version 1.0, on Nov 18, 2008
Perhaps I am missing something but why isn't there a direct search box so that you can simply type in the name of the restaurant you are looking for and go directly to it? Currently you have to navigate several screens in order to select a given restaurant by name. That is inefficient and awkward. It is ironic that the "Find a Table" tab uses a Spotlight icon but in fact does not let you perform any kind of real search.

Also, since I like to try new places being able to read reviews and make my own would also me helpful. One more thing I just thought of, weblinks to the restaurants menus would be awesome. If that is possible. When out and about that option would be nice.

This is very handy app for those of us who already use OpenTable to make dining reservations online.  However, many of the features of the website are missing, such as searching by cuisine. 
ALSO the email reservation function does not work!  The only info that loads into the email is the first word in the name of the restaurant, and NO actual reservation information you'd expect, such as ... Umm ... perhaps the date and time of the reservation, as well as location info like address, and party size?  Serious flaw.

Adding some of the advanced features available on the website would be great (e.g. search by "my favorites", cuisine, neighborhood).  Restaurant website links in the restaurant description entries would be helpful as well.

5 stars, "Make reservations without calling :-)", by wishfulwistful, for version 1.0.1, on Nov 29, 2008

5 stars, "Opentable's a cut above other restaurant apps", by pedroserano, for version 1.0.1, on Dec 2, 2008
Opentable is an awesome service with a great website. Their website has had basic iPhone capabailities for a while and this app seems to be just that with some cool improvements- location awareness for finding local places and mapping them. 5 stars for being able to book the best restaurants in any major city right on my phone. And hoping an update will have more features from the website.

5 stars, "Open Table works great in KC!", by eight4seven, for version 1.0.1, on Dec 2, 2008
I live in Kansas City and I am really impressed with the how simple and smooth this app is for making reservations at KC's finest restaurants. I like the feature that shows the restaurant on a map within the app, and after making the reservation there's an option to use Google Maps for directions. Open Table has made a nice addition to my life.

4 stars, "Great Application....but....", by Very Hungry, for version 1.0.1, on Dec 6, 2008
Great idea, but it has its limitations.   When searching for a restaurant, it will list the 20 which are closest to your current location, but if you are planning on being in an area farther than that later in the evening for dinner, you are out of luck.  There is no way of changing your search location unless you are looking for a restaurant in a major city listed in the pull down menu.  If you are in fact in a major city, the pin locatons are nearly one on top of another and I could not figure out a way to zoom in on the map in order to spread the pins out and get a better idea of exactly where the restaurants were located.  Perhaps just operator error.   But overall, a pretty neat application.  Hey...its free.

3 stars, "Good, but not great", by Sfadams, for version 1.0.1, on Dec 17, 2008
First of all, for you idiots complaining that it doesn't find restaraunts in your city. It will only find restaraunts with which you can book reservations through open table!!!!!  It doesn't find all restaraunts in your area. If you want that, use google maps, yelp or something similar. As for open table, search would be nice. Also, when it shows restaurants around me it sometimes omits some restaurants. If I search by area, then they show up. Overall, the app is handy but really could use some easy tweaks to make it even better.

Very user-friendly and simple. I really like the ability to pull up available restaurants based on current location.

I love Opentable - the restaurants that use it always get my business before those I have to talk to via phone.

3 stars, "great app, very close", by Bob(OH), for version 1.0.1, on Jan 13, 2009
Great app, pretty good implementation of the web site.  BUT...  not well tied into Google maps, since it doesn't allow zooming in or out, and for one local restaurant, it simply shows the street and one cross street.  Also, the web page shows links to the restaurant's menu, which is quite helpful, but missing here.  Overall, this app is very good for simply making reservations IF you know where the restaurant is and what the food is like but is a bit lacking otherwise.  But frankly, I'm still going back to the web page most of the time.

Love the ability to make reservations on my iPhone, my Open Table acct had sat idle for so long, but not anymore.  OT definitely needs a "Favorites" List and a "Wish" List for easily saving restaurants you want to remember so you don't have to look them up every time.  Also, would be good to list maybe the last 3 Recent Locations, and search by cusine is a must.

3 stars, "Would be 5 stars but....", by Scubafiend, for version 1.1, on Feb 8, 2009
I recently did a search and only got 8 returns- well below the smallest max number of results. The restaurant I was interested in did not show up so I expected it was not on opentable and called directly. Later on the restaurant website I see the opentable logo so I rerun the search and it shows up if I increase the max number of records even though I STILL have nowhere near the max records for the bottom threshold. There is no distance setting so that isn't it. Reported as a bug.

Be aware. I expect to still get my points but I may be crazy. Also may not keep the app if I don't get reliable results...

Update- Additionally I cannot locate a contact email address for them! Perhaps it is well hidden but the end result is the same.

Helps you find a good place to eat where you are at the time you want, with little fuss.  I think this is best suited for business trips / vacations to places you're not so familiar with, when you're looking for something better than a chain but you have no idea where anything is.  Super convienient that it makes the reservation as well as making the phone number available and clickable.  Definitely worth the download.

This application is best for those of us who have used Open Table for years. I have used it a half dozen times and it is actually much better than the web site. Best for travel when you are looking for a good available restaurant. Still a few quirks. Rarely returns full number of requested restaurants. Can't cancel reservations fromthis app (have to use the web site). These are minor quibbles for an excellent FREE application that has found me some great meals on more than one occasion.

In fact, I prefer this app to the OpenTable Web interface. I live in Austin, TX, and the OpenTable network is pretty large here, so most restaurants that take reservations are available. Being able to pickup my iPhone and make a reservation "on the fly" at any time is a great convenience.

As long as you don't have to type into the search bar it works fine, however. I have to give it one star because this is really a major flaw (tried on OS 2.2.1 and 3.0, and crashes even after uninstalling and re-installing).

This app seems like it would be really, insanely useful. I love OpenTable and would probably use this every time I go out. Its biggest flaw, though, is that it is terribly designed. Panes slide bizarrely, search is really REALLY hard to find, and parts of the app are just illogically slow.

4 stars, "Good app works well, would like a few enhancements", by dfsatl, for version 1.1.3, on Aug 11, 2009
Works well, stable. The biggest issue I see is that the Menu button displays a link to a web page within the application window. If the website has changed, you land in the home page, and now you're navigating around the website. If the menu is stored as a PDF, it seems to try and open the document in a new window, like Safari would, but it can't. You have to go to the restaurant website in Safari to see the menu. Need an enhancement either to launch the PDF in the app window or launch Safari.

I'd also like an option to add a calendar entry after completing a reservation (maybe generate a vcal or ical record, if the iPhone API supports that).

BTW, you can search for restaurants, even if they don't have availability. First, you need a result set, so you do need to pick a city, time/date and number of people. After you press Find a Table, a search window appears above the result set. Navigate to the search window and start typing, and restaurants with availability and matching names appear.

5 stars, "iPhone Version is Stellar", by number3s, for version 2.0, on Sep 6, 2009
Have been a user of the PC version for some time - but iPhone enhancements knock it out of the park. The feature to select your current location and specify a number of restaurants within a certain mile radius really narrows down the options beautifully. Not only do you get to see times available, but you can link to a menu (absolutely essential to making a selection) and see diner reviews. Map feature also shows you how to get there. If you want a memory jogger for recalling all the places you've been, or are willing to try something different, this freebie takes the cake. Try it out, you won't be disappointed. And, IT'S FREE.

I love the OpenTable website.  This app is a small subset.  It only searches by your current location.  No keyword or neighborhood searches.  A comment on the review(s) that say this app doesn't represent all restaurants or shows all available tables:  restaurants choose to participate and usually limit how many tables are available through this site.  So calling WILL often yield a table if OT shows nothing available.

There are nearby restaurants in DC that use the Open Table reservation service, but that do not come up when I try to access them through the search function. I assume this is because of the limitation of the 100 closest. Maybe I'm missing something, but shouldn't there be a way of searching all Open Table-participating restaurants in a city? I ended up making the reservation through the Open Table link on the restaurant website.

4 stars, "very useful app, could use some interface improvements", by Dr Barry, for version 2.0.1, on Oct 13, 2009
I rate this highly mostly for what it can do. I was not even aware of the OpenTable service, and having it on the iPhone to make online reservations is great. It has a nice clean interface and for its basic function works well. But a few simple interface features would help. Needs a favorites function to save restaurants before deciding to make a reservation so you can go back later. Allow cut and paste text and/or to email some info (eg. location, description, reviews) so you can decide with someone's help. Also, in many/most cases for me, I did not have the map option until I picked a specific restaurant (which is different than looks on app store picts) - it would be nice to be able to see where a group of restaurants are so that one can pick by location. Also a map linke to the google map app (if not built in) would be nice.

While in Denver visiting friends we left a show rather late with dim prospects on where to dine for the evening - Open Table to the rescue! While the gang was heming and hawing about where was still serving food, where to go, what to eat... I found a great Mexican place still open, still serving food, made the reservation, had directions, made the anouncment and we all had a wonderful meal. 

Can't beat that for a free app. Great job!!

4 stars, "Best app there is.", by GSX-R rider, for version 2.0.1, on Nov 24, 2009
I had to give this app 4 stars because you lose credibility when you give all 5. I have nothing to do with making apps or whatever company makes these things. My review is 100% legitimate and sincere. So disclaimer out of the way, it's on to the review. 

Absolutely perfect and flawless app. I've made reservations many times using OpenTable. Not once has there been a problem. The only limits are the idiots who don't put their restaurants on  it. As for those that do, you are assured my continued business. I only wish other apps worked this well and were asnuseful as this one. 

As for the whiners who gave this app bad reviews- it's a free app. Most complaints are BS. Probably posted by children or retards. If you can't figure out how to use this app you're a MORON.

Bottom line---&gt; get this before it costs money.

3 stars, "Needs more...", by coleblu84, for version 2.0.1, on Nov 29, 2009

4 stars, "Account", by taziesmer, for version 2.0.1, on Dec 1, 2009

3 stars, "Great system, major limitation", by OpenTable, for version 2.0.1, on Jan 2, 2010
I have used OpenTable for a long time and have enjoyed using the system throughout the US and even abroad.  When the iPhone/iPod app for OpenTable became available I immediately downloaded it and started using it.  The app works well, finding restaurants in major cities mostly in the US, providing some restaurant information, and booking reservations.  The major limitation is that the OpenTable app now requires iPhone/iPod OS software version 3.0 or greater to run.  Yet many users have chosen not to upgrade because it costs money and some older apps run better on the older OS.  To make OpenTable only compatible with the newer Apple OS is a major limitation, so for now I'll simply make reservations by telephone (find the restaurant and phone number with Google) or go to OpenTable's website (computer or web-enabled phone) to make my reservations.  It's too bad OpenTable missed this obvious point when the revised their app.

OpenTable has always been useful and convenient for me. It's so easy to book a table. However it could be a much better app if more restaurants participated. The search interface is limiting and confusing. (To those who don't know how to search by name, it is possible if you first pick a region, then tap All Restaurants. Yes, confusing.) But a good app nonetheless.

I have tried to make reservations with this app about 15 times.  Of those 15 tries i was only able to find the restaurant I was looking for once and I am in Chicago, kindof a big market.  To top it off, the one time it actually had the restaurant I was looking for it messed up my reservation, I originally made the res. for 2 people but later the same day changed it to 4.  I got two confirmations each saying table for two, I later called the restaurant to make sure they had my res. for 4, they diddn't they had me down for 2 tables for 2.  Maybe yelp will add reservation making capabilities soon.  Don't dl, waste of time.

I am stunned. I don't think they could make this app more useless. I like Opentable and its services, but this program is totally worthless. It's easier to use the iPhone's map app to find and call the restaurant to make a reservation. 

Others have said it, but I didn't believe them: you really can't search for restaurants on this. You can't. The 'locator' function for restaurants nearby doesn't seem to work, either. Shouldn't FINDING the restaurant you want be the primary purpose of an app like this? A disgrace. One star.

5 stars, "If You Eat Out You Need This", by iphone rick, for version 2.0.1, on Feb 22, 2010
I am so tired of people writing reviews who don't seem to have ever used the program. Yes, you absolutely can search by type of cuisine. This program is wonderful. I have used OpenTable for quite a while from my computer, but this takes it one step further by using your location to find and reserve nearby restaurants. Aside from the convenience of making a reservation in a few seconds, you can see what reservation times are available and what restaurants are near your location. Plus you get points for reservations kept, and those points turn into $$$ you can spend at any restaurant listed in Open Table. We have gotten gift certificates totalling $20 so far, spent at a restaurant we had never been to before. It is a great system and I use it all the time. Very user friendly and flexible on the iPhone.

4 stars, "Request for the app developer", by DiningOrganizer, for version 3.0.2, on Apr 8, 2010
It's great to have mobile access to opentable. The one thing I miss most from the site is the ability to book in multiple names. When a restaurant knows my spouse's name but not mine,  the site let's me choose the name for the booking.

1 star, "Make It Work", by JasPF, for version 3.0.2, on Apr 25, 2010
You can't search by restaurant name. The location function works but the program likes to hang up on it. Try to login to open table account and it just keeps having connection errors with their servers. I really think this could be done better and without bugs as this should be simple or open table will loose interest with their users! I look forward to a working program.

2 stars, "Awesome Service, Less-than-awesome App", by Xombie11, for version 3.0.2, on Jun 15, 2010
I really like the restaurants available; all the ones it lists are in my experience the best of the best in my area. Unlike other restaurant review services, there are lots of reviews to give you an idea of what your experience will be like; and also most of the reviews are well-written and by persons of experience and taste. Ive never heard of OpenTable before, but now that I've had I'll definitely continue using it an reccommending it to my friends. I also like the restaurant menu feature that can be accessed from within the app.

My only qualm is that the app itself is unirganized and that the icon is kinda ugly. Get rid of the text on the icon itself! 

Thanks!

1 star, "Bunk app; does not search!", by Fanatic4rf, for version 3.0.2, on Jun 18, 2010
Despite the positive reviews of the OpenTable app, I have to give it a one-star rating. The search for a restaurant function does not work, as every time I try to enter a name and click the "done" button, nothing happens. And yes, my iPhone OS is current, my settings allow my location to be found, and I'm an OpenTable account holder. 

I have to assume that it may be because they'll only let you search for restaurants in their network, but even known restaurants won't allow the "done" button to submit the query. 

Frustrating.

4 stars, "Very nice start", by Jasher0, for version 3.0.2, on Jun 28, 2010
It is very good for a first iPhone app, but it does need a few improvements. I think it should link the address to a real Google Maps link so that you can zoom and get directions. They should include the restaurants phone numbers with a link so that you can quickly call. I would like the full search capabilities from the full website, such as searching by name, cuisine (Nearby) and by available bonuses. Also would be nice to have the menus listed so that we could see actual prices. But not to complain, it is nice to see more companies making free usefull iPhone apps.

4 stars, "Couldnt Modify a Same-Day Reservation", by UWSider, for version 3.0.2, on Jul 8, 2010
I haven't had a problem searching for a restaurant by name. However, when I tried to modify a same-day reservation to an earlier time, the program wouldn't let me. My original reservation was for 7:45PM tonight. When I went to modify it, the time simply showed as 7:45; when I hit the "Modify" button, I kept getting a message that I couldn't modify a reservation for a time in the past. The program was taking 7:45 as 7:45AM, and I was trying to modify it at 10:30AM. It should've known I was modifying a 7:45PM (19:45) reservation and allowed me to do it. Please fix this bug.

Wow, I've never seen an app that works so poorly.  Did they even test this thing?  
It doesn't know when to ask permission to use current location.
Selecting the time is non-functional - you pick a time from the selector and it fills in something random in the box.
Today's times are grayed out.
Searching by name is worthless - it doesn't give you anything unless you nail a name that happens to be in the database.

I'm on an iPhone 4.  Maybe that's the problem??

-Frustrated.

4 stars, "App is good - needs update - still shows <null>, <null> for reserved date/time", by pd_denver, for version 3.0.4, on Aug 15, 2010
I love the app - it does what it should very well.  I use it frequently to make and change reservations without issues and I find that most restaurants in my area (Denver metro) for which you actually need a reservation are available on opentable.

One issue I have is that any reservation that is made -- whether via website or on the phone itself -- shows &lt;null&gt;,&lt;null&gt; for date and time through the app even though the restaurant name and # of points for the reservation do display properly.  You have to go to the website to remember when your reservations are; it's a fundamental data error in the app.

Though it's a great app still for making reservations, if you're having to make them weeks in advance for better restaurants (welcome to Denver) it's not passable to omit the date and time.

I live in the San Francisco east bay area, I love my Chevys Fresh-Mex, Applebees and Outback Steakhouses. Why aren't regular restaurants like those on OpenTable? Instead it has all of the more high end and on the "expensive side" restaurants. Still LOVE the app though!

1 star, "Could be greatly improved", by Hannah-pants, for version 3.2, on Jan 22, 2011
Very useful service, but not a very good app. 1) does not have multiple-tasking so you lose search results and it resets all search criteria if you leave the app - not great if you want to do anything else while booking a table, such as look up the review on Yelp or organize with friends via phone or email before booking; 2) you cannot filter for only the AVAILABLE tables when searching in a particular city. In other words, after typing in search criteria, it returns every table in a geographic location of your choosing and you have to manually search through this list for those that have an open table (unreasonable in a place like Manhattan that returns hundreds of results). It's fine if you search using you current geo-location, but that is also uncommon in a place like New York City where you often want to travel to another neighborhood to eat; and 3) although it saves you account details, it does not keep you logged in so you have to do this each time you book a restaurant; 4) no place to send feedback inside app...

1 star, "Careful what you wish for....", by neuroproff, for version 3.2, on Feb 7, 2011
I only use this App occasionally, but I like the idea of making a reservation on the fly, without calling (or so I thought)... Yesterday, I reserved a table for two at a very nice restaurant in town. When we arrived, the place was closed! No mention in Open Table that the tables weren't open (LOL). I am just glad I did not make use of their advertised service (in the confirmation email) to "arrive in style" and rent a Limo (through them, of course). I think this free App is landing in the trash. No point reserving on the fly if I myself have to confirm over the phone if the restaurant is actually open that day.

An exemplary app...I somehow slid into someone's cancelled reservation for an exclusive restaurant in New York City, waited only 15 minutes while others waited in excess of 2 and a half hours. Definitely an application you need to have if you're a person who doesn't like to wait, or if you're too important to wait.

1 star, "Absolutely terrible app", by Foodluv8r, for version 3.2, on Feb 15, 2011
Absolutely terrible app.  Crashes on almost every search.  The menu layout makes no sense,  their website is much more usefull,  even on iPhone.
App doesn't remember locations so I have to keep putting back in the name of the restaurant and city,  this simply doesn't make any sense.  Also the book a reservation simply tries to book the reservation and any random place, no favorites on booking screen,  developers should take a look at the seamlessweb app, although they are delivery true menu structure is 1000 times better than this crappy app.

1 star, "False data", by R-men, for version 3.2, on Feb 15, 2011
So on 2 occasion were the app literally lied about prices.   Ex: firehouse restaurant was said that prices were from 31-50 but in reality it was 115 dollars per person.  250$$$  including tax ( which includes no purchases of drinks) plus 15% tip which adds about 40 + 7 for parking, and the grand total 300 dollars.  Complete crap!   Worst app ever.

1 star, "Update did not help", by Rodrigo1, for version 3.2, on Feb 16, 2011

1 star, "OpenTable Website is okay - but their app", by TVB Wisconsin, for version 3.2, on Feb 21, 2011
On both the iPhone and iPad, you are given the option to search by restaurant name but neither work.  The iPad version crashes a lot.  It's simply very restrictive on being able to actually use this app efficiently and effectively.  The app is very frustrating to use - the easier way to access a reservation for a OpenTable restaurant is to use their website on your iPhone or iPad.  Seriously.

3 stars, "Mostly Satisfied", by DeBooJ, for version 3.2, on Feb 23, 2011

5 stars, "Great App. Makes reservations a breeze!", by ConservativeHoosier, for version 3.2, on Mar 29, 2011
Despite some poor reviews. I have iPhone 3GS and have had no problems with crashing. Fantastic app. Restaurants are slightly limited depending on which area you are using it, but there is generally a nice selection. I don't blame that on OpenTable, but more so on the restaurants having out-of-date computer systems. If you want to make restaurant reservations a breeze, download this app. And best of all, it's FREE!

3 stars, "Needs more restaurants", by TwoDogSAHM, for version 3.2, on Mar 30, 2011
I often have to multitask &amp; can't always call a restaurant for a reservation, so I've used OpenTable for years.  I travel quite a bit, so it's helpful &amp; convenient to see/locate restaurants in the city I'm in.  The downfalls to this app are that it needs to be more user-friendly &amp; it doesn't seem to have a lot of restaurants available.  OpenTable might want to start marketing their service a bit more to get more restaurants onboard...

Absolutely miserable navigation and UI. You have to jump thru a ton of hoops to get basic choices.

Great website but terrible app.

4 stars, "Restaurant Reviews", by IAmTheArchitect, for version 3.2, on Apr 25, 2011
One thing that would be very helpful is if we could write Restaurant Reviews in the app itself!  The best time to write one is when you're waiting for the check or when the experience is the freshest in your mind.  Most, if not all of the time, I forget to write the review when I get back to a real computer.  Especially if going back to the office after lunch.  It's not really that professional to be doing this on an office computer.

Just put the ability to write reviews in the app!  That's where it needs to be!

3 stars, "Not bad, but...", by Joe65377, for version 3.3.1, on Jul 28, 2011
Needs:

-to reflect the number of restaurants on the website-- tons are missing

-to let us select a search radius- I don't know what it's preset to, but OpenTable restaurants less than a mile away aren't showing up (possibly related to aforementioned dearth of listings)

-to let us define search parameters before we do the search. For example, if I want to find an Indian restaurant within 5 miles, I'm SOL. Right now, I can only filter on the basis of what you already have found in the limited search for "nearby".

Basically, I want the comprehensiveness of restaurant listings on the Yelp app on this one. Maybe they'll partner with you and filter out non-OpenTable places.

4 stars, "Pls allow to add to iCal from app", by HazelNole, for version 3.0.4, on Aug 10, 2011
This is a great app that allows you to conveniently search restaurants for reservations, especially as OpenTable adds more and more restaurants to it's network. The one thing I'd like to see added to the app is the ability to add reservations to your calendar. Currently, you'd have to visit the website from a desktop to add the reservation to your Outlook/iCal calendar, which would subsequently sync with your phone (if you're set up to so that). Other than that, great app! Cheers!

1 star, "Cannot switch diners?", by hellcatjen, for version 3.3.1, on Oct 17, 2011
The new app on ios5 fails to allow you to make a reservation in the name of another diner.  This takes away the convenience factor of the app. I now just go to their mobile site to make the reservation. Plus, this way I can bypass the ads. It would be great to have more functionality restored.

Great app!  Yes, ads are annoying but a minor issue overall.  I've found several interesting restaurants I would never have discovered if they hadn't been part of the OT system.  My only quibble is that I'd like to see the next update incorporate the ability to review visited restaurants directly from the app instead of having to log into website.

2 stars, "This app will cheat you...", by Sapphir3blu3, for version 3.3.1, on Dec 27, 2011
I would never have known that one of my fave local restaurants had 1000-point tables when I went to book via this app, if I had not happened to notice it on the full-featured OpenTable.com earlier in the day. When my husband said "Let's go to X tonight" I reserved using the app &amp; went back in to see the point value and it said just 100. So I used the app to cancel, went to the website and went for the exact same time, got the 1000. App: kiiiinda useless! Wonder how many points I've been cheated out of by this "bug" without knowing it? As an OpenTable member since 2002, I can't even imagine. Will be reserving via website from now on.

I use Open Table all the time.  I travel a lot and need to make dinner or lunch arrangements on the fly and Open Table has saved the day many times.  While others are calling around to see what's available, I've already booked the table.  Generally speaking, if you make a special request, the restaurant tries to accommodate you.  Recommended!

The app does what it's supposed to do: allow you to make opentable reservations. However, there are some features that I would definitely like to see added. Background support is one of them - if you exit the app prior to completing the reservation, you need to go through the whole process again. I would expect that the app saves your prior session in case you need to complete a prior search. Also, I would also like to see a horizontal scrolling feature for the available hours. Currently, it appears that you only get to view 3 time slots and need to back up in order to view additional times.

Hate the fact that with the i-tunes updates, Apple won't tell you that the new version is not compatable with previous versions of iOS until it has already deleted your previous application.  If the system would at least give a warning prior to the download, one could keep the previous version until absolutely necessary.

BTW--Does anyone have a copy of the previous version of OpenTable for i phone?

5 stars, "Extremely disappointing", by ivanski_sf, for version 3.5, on Mar 4, 2012
Really basic app that does little more than the website itself. There's no way to save favorite restaurants, an extremely clunky multistep to select specific restaurants, no way to let the "no availability results" crowd out the possible ones, no way to sort or filter the results except by proximity (when searching by GPS) or alphabetical order, and no way to map the restaurant or get directions.

They should take a look at Yelp's app for superior execution, even if they don't do reservations

I wish only that one could easily manipulate the dates instead of its automatic defaulting to the present day's date. Whenever I want to switch from the present date to one in the future when choosing a restaurant from the alphabetical list on the right side, I can do it only by typing in a search-by-name for the restaurant, which is essentially starting over. It would also be nice to have menus right there in the App, instead of having to switch over to the Internet.

5 stars, "Terrific App!", by foolishbride, for version 3.5, on Mar 7, 2012
Used this app to try out restaurants in our new community after a move. Got to know neighboring towns and the local favorites. You can search in a radius around where you are then by type of food or by which restaurants have availability at your chosen time. A description of the place is shown, their menu, diners' reviews and price level. All useful in deciding where to go. Also great when traveling. And those accumulated points ARE worth something: I just cashed in 2K points for a $20 dining check at a member restaurant. Another perk!

I eat out a few times a month and love discovering new places. Open Table makes it so easy to make reservations and the reviews are great. I love that I earn dining points and have earned at least 1 or  2 dining checks per year. Both the iPhone and iPad apps work pretty dependable and are easy to navigate. But I wish multi- tasking worked better. I don't like having to redo my search every time I exit and re- enter the app. One additional suggestion would be to find a way to integrate the app with Denver's (or another city) restaurant week menus and information. Keep up the good work Open Table!

Open Table is like the express lane on a tollway!  The best features are that you can make a rez without worrying about when you are calling and, you don't get put on hold.  Very convenient but I haven't used any accumulated points yet...I guess I should look into that.

This is a first class service that is fast and pays you cash and gives the customer the chance to review your restaurant selections and then make a instant reservation.
Very soon you will be receiving a check to use at any restaurant. So it's a win win for being a Open Table user.

5 stars, "Daily user!", by Idyguy, for version 3.6, on Mar 18, 2012
The Open Table apps for iPad and iPhone are both FANTASTIC. I use them almost daily. I can make reservations on the fly, find a great spot in a community I'm unfamiliar with, check out the menu to insure it sounds tasty and read reviews of other diners so I know what I'm getting myself into. The apps are easy to use, offer the ability to sort by proximity to my current location and even allow me to request my favorite table or server.
--
4 stars, "Dining 4 $$", by Kbsmd80, for version 3.6, on Mar 18, 2012
I love that so many independent restaurants use Open Table, allowing us to earn points toward a future experience. It has almost gotten to the point that if a restaurant is not on Open Table, I almost will not even consider going there. We are not chain people such that the fact that so many terrific solo places are on tells us that restaurants see value in the approach and care about the ease with which their clientele can book a table. I do not mind that there are restrictions re: time, 30 day out, etc. as it still works and allows some fairness into the process.

It's so much easier than having to call and hope someone at the other end will pick up. We eat out a lot and I must use it twice a week plus I then get to rate our dinner which is a big plus instead of rating it on Yelp.
--
3 stars, "Handy but lots of room for improvement.", by FloraDC, for version 3.6, on Mar 19, 2012
There should be a faster way to get to the restaurants you want. Having tabs by letter would help, or having an easily accessible list of favorites.  I really don't like the map function because it only shows the restaurants in that particular part of the alphabet, which doesn't give you an idea of what's around. But it is handy and hopefully will continue to improve.

3 stars, "All restaurants good??", by FathaMike, for version 3.6, on Mar 29, 2012
Open Table is useful, a good app. But something is wrong: almost every restaurant winds up with a four-star overall rating. Is every restaurant in town that good? Or bad? And the restaurant list on the right would be easier to use if one didn't have to click the up/down arrows so many times (how about one long list).

This is one of the best aps. You can find which Restuarants have space, and see a menu and get a review of what it is like. What a time saver. We seldom eat at a place that is not listed since they have so many listed. We use them in Cincinnati, Hilton Head Island and NYC.

OpenTable works as advertised. It's my go to method for making reservations. I just wish all my favorite restaurants were part of the OpenTable network.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's a little sluggish on my poor old iPad 1.

I use this app a lot. Overall it's very convenient and has a lot of choices for restaurants. I agree with the other review requesting the ability to narrow the search. Just being able to choose the suburb on the first search would help.
--
4 stars, "Ok", by CJ Glynn, for version 3.6, on Mar 31, 2012
Fine app, but it shouldn't restart your search which you switch away from the app (like to go to Yelp to check reviews).  The app should remember the current state and go back to that same place when you switch back not it.

2 stars, "OK but has some usability issues", by CleeTheDog, for version 3.6, on Mar 31, 2012
Overall the app seems to work well except this one really annoying issue. If you switch to a different app and then return to OpenTable you have to start over again. As an app developer myself this is totally unacceptable, the application should save the current state so that you can pick up where you left off. This issue rendered the app pretty much useless to me since my wife kept asking me questions that required me to switch away while in the middle of something. I finally quit in  frustration and told her to call the restaurant herself.

3 stars, "Ok, with one super annoying bug", by HipPTreeHugger, for version 3.6, on Apr 2, 2012
Switching to another app and back requires starting your entire search over again, including waiting for it to locate you, date/time select, party size, location, and all filters. Yikes. Really annoying if you're trying to check a map or your calendar or email while making a reservation. Fix this and 4 stars; add more restaurants and five!

3 stars, "works but crappy usability", by grayedog, for version 3.6, on Apr 2, 2012
As others have noted, having to restart every time you navigate away and then back to the app is awful design. The other thing that I hate is the need to hit the tiny up &amp; down arrows to page thru results. Why? This isn't part of the browser experience, why make it a requirement on the app. 

Fix these and I would give it five.

4 stars, "Good enough on the go", by asdlkjfasd, for version 3.6, on Apr 10, 2012
This app is a reasonable way to access the OpenTable reservation system.  The new 3.0 feature to touch the "star" to indicate a new favorite is useful.  It provides good search and filtering mechanisms, although sometimes using neighborhood names are problematical since you might not be familiar with them.  It would be nice if the map outlined the neighborhoods, or allowed you indicate by touching the map where you'd like to center your search (it will use your current location, but "current" isn't always where you'll be later :-).  It would also be useful if the app could enter the reservation into your calendar, as the website allows with Outlook (I'm not sure, but this may be a limitation due to Apple's iPhone OS, rather than the OpenTable app).

5 stars, "One of the Best Apps I Own", by Abu Nuhas, for version 3.6, on Apr 10, 2012
The Open Table App is one of the most useful, user-friendly, and--from this layman's perspective--one of the most sophisticated and comprehensive applications in my repertoire. From the ability to search nationwide or locally through GPS technology and the ease of contributing to and accessing an archive of fairly reliable patron ratings, to the invite feature, the onestep cancel, and other more rarified (but now and then very welcome) bells and whistles (e.g., the option to order flowers for a special dinner partner), Open Table is my preferred way to place reservations. And just when you think the app couldn't get any better, an update comes online which reminds you of the diligence and hard work it takes to create a product of this quality. Bravo to the creators and maintainers of this wonderful digital tool. I only hope that you folks would consider hiring yourselves out as consultants to troubleshoot other high profile apps (such as those of the airlines--they are in desperate need of help!) that just can't seem to get it right. Then again, given the cutback in services I've been experiencing lately when I fly, they probably can't afford you. :-)

The problem is a software glitch. When you go to confirm, it asks for your number. Once you add it, there is no confirm button. I learned that you click cancel and LP and behold you can confirm. Sometimes when I am in NY, it is hard to search by name.

Very easy to use, IF you are looking for a restaurant close to your current location. If you are looking for a restaurant near somewhere else in your general locale, it's not so easy. Should be able to enter an address (of movie theater, for example, or an office building), and then search for a restaurant from that point.

3 stars, "Good app, but flunks some basics", by AD94901, for version 3.6, on Apr 12, 2012
This would get five stars if ONLY it automatically returned to your last search.  I had to exit to look at a menu on the web, and then had to repeat my search when I went back into Open Table.  

This is the kind of elementary feature they should have thought of.  If there were menu links embedded in the app, I wouldn't need to go out, but there are none, so they need to not force me to redo my search every time I slip out to look at a menu in Safari.

5 stars, "Functions flawlessly", by EndoDr, for version 3.6, on Apr 13, 2012
Have been using Open Table for 10 years. This app makes on the go reservations really easy. The points program is a nice little perk too. Especially if you are a frequent diner. This is a terrific way to find a table for a group if you are last minute too. I scheduled a group of 17 with 2 hours notice and didn't have to make dozens of phone calls. The reviews are pretty good for helping select but tend to favor the positive so check some other review sites if unfamiliar with the restaurant. Has always worked like a charm, even the option for special requests. Love it!

It has most of the restaurants that are mentioned in Chowhound forums. It works in most cities we visit. 

It is fast, easy to use, let's you forward info to others coming to dinner,etc , etc. It is a great App.

I've grown to rely on OpenTable....  quick, easy, accurate.  Never had a reservation go wrong, special requests are heeded.  Ultimately, it depends on how much attention the individual restaurants pay, but they all - across the spectrum -- treat the reservation with at least as much attention as a reservation thru any channel.  Only downside is when you're looking for a restaurant that is not a system member.

Much improved stability makes this indispensable tool far more efficient and less frustrating than it used to be.  Still needs a little work on menu access for some restaurants.  Perhaps standardizing the format for basic info would help as an option to the stylized versions produced by the restaurant.

4 stars, "Very useful app", by HansFens, for version 3.6, on May 1, 2012
I've found OpenTable to be a great time saver and extremely easy to use. The only caveat I would offer would-be restaurant-goers is unrelated to the app, but has to do with OpenTable itself (apparently). Sometimes, OT says there are no tables, but when you call the restaurant, there are plenty available. This probably is due to the amount of tables the restaurants allocate to OT. In any case, I highly recommend this app!

2 stars, "Just OK, website is much better", by TylerL05, for version 3.6, on May 1, 2012
The app is not great due to an absence of features

- does not appear to utilize full account info (phone number, for example)
- does not appear to save and send special requests
- unable to scroll full results of search, without using the down arrow button
It is a nice to have app, but the website is much better.

Would be helpful if the app could remember my notes because I have to write about my sons' food allergies every time. Even better would be checklist of allergies of concern for each reservation.

3 stars, "Not the best", by Dcvhcbn, for version 3.4.2, on May 5, 2012
I love OT but this app leaves something to be desired: the ability to easily change search location by entering a new city or zip. Hard to find restaurants when I have to choose from a predetermined list and then filter by neighborhood, hoping the one I want is listed.

2 stars, "Booking great, app needs significant update", by Tommy Pinchin', for version 3.6, on May 5, 2012
The ability to book reservations is terrific and I use it a lot. However, this app is exceptionally frustrating to use. It never saves state, but starts over each time you launch. If you start from a location, you can't specify a future date. If you start from a date, you have little control over location. The only way to get both is to start with a particular restaurant. This would be much better if you could move to an area in the map, pick a future date, and then get a list of what is nearby, like every other map application. Love the functionality. Please update the user interface. Thanks!

5 stars, "Easy app to use", by Hpyle, for version 3.4.2, on May 5, 2012
For those who dine out often this is an easy app to use. Once u pick fave restaurants it becomes even easier. Can choose tables at popular restaurants months out which is nice. Highly recommended
--
5 stars, "Great", by Katie Lua, for version 3.6, on May 5, 2012
This app has been a lifesaver. I've used it to find the first available openings at hotspots, and I often use it to get a last minute reservation based on wherever I am.  

An improvement I'd like to see:  when I pinpoint a location, say a theater, and try to find what restaurants are available in the vicinity, it seems that not all of the choices are shown at once, and change with small movements on the map.

5 stars, "100% Success", by KMMTexas, for version 3.6, on May 6, 2012
OpenTable is the best app for finding great meals and venues! We travel nonstop and we use OT in every city and have never been disappointed.  Won't leave home with out it.

5 stars, "My favorite app ever!", by Village2, for version 3.6, on May 6, 2012

--
5 stars, "Open Table is an easy to use app", by The Record Maven, for version 3.6, on May 6, 2012
This app is easier to use on an iPad or iPhone than it is through its web-browser. Also, it appears that Open Table continues to expand its list of available restaurants.  One hint: if it says a certain time isn't available try calling the restaurant directly. Many times they will accommodate.

3 stars, "Good but inferior to web site", by RappinDD, for version 3.6, on May 7, 2012
The biggest problem with the app is that you cannot search by stars in the app the way you can on the web site. So I NEVER use the app to book reso's at places or on cities i am unfamiliar with. HUGE disappointment.

5 stars, "Handy App", by Peter & Beverly, for version 3.3.1, on May 7, 2012
Easy to use.  So much more than calling restaurants or going to several websites to see who has availability.
Nice to preview menu on occasion.  
Also gives you some handy suggestions/reminders as to what's out there.
No mistakes yet on the restaurant's part or that of Open Table.
Although sometimes the $$$ don't reflect what you should expect to spend because they are based on entree only, which may be a la carte or not.
  Not sure what the points are for, but we're racking them up!

1 star, "Absolutely hate this site", by Fool me once....., for version 3.6, on May 8, 2012
Sure, once you get to the right city, it's a piece of cake.  
But when I'm traveling,  trying to make a reservation in a different  city is like pulling teeth.

Maybe I'm just an idiot.  But half the time, I end up going back to Travel Advisor because I just give up on Open Table.

It's just not worth the effort trying to do a "custom search."
--
2 stars, "Just ok app", by Cinmack122, for version 3.6, on May 9, 2012
Needs to be much more intuitive-find it easier to use on the iPhone even with 4 point type. Agree with the traveler comments- often faster to pick up the phone!

4 stars, "Gat but could be better", by Ryno57, for version 3.6, on May 9, 2012
I love the app for getting reservations set when I'm traveling.  The app could be easier to use for searching. Watch for the fact it defaults to today's date if you make any change while searching.

5 stars, "Love it", by jtjmaui, for version 3.6, on May 9, 2012
Use this all the time, easy to make fast reservations.  Search works great if you have the location services enabled.  I just wish every restaurant was on opentable.
--
3 stars, "App is OK but slow", by WC man, for version 3.6, on May 9, 2012
One of the best features of the iPad is instant use.  Sadly this app negates the iPad speed.  Every time I open it I get the whirling "wait" icon.  Once it finally loads and initiates, it works well.
--
4 stars, "Good but", by Hpeugene, for version 3.6, on May 9, 2012
It is good but it is a bit challenging to find locations in Atlanta. It needs to be smaller areas or the ability to put in an address, like a hotel we are in.

3 stars, "It's okay", by i got a guy, for version 3.6, on May 10, 2012
The OpenTable iPad app does serve its primary function of facilitating restaurant reservations. Unfortunately, the app isn't exactly the most intuitive or user friendly and falls short of the desktop site. For instance, after selecting a restaurant and time users don't appear to have the easy ability to view different dates or times for their selected restaurant without beginning their search again. 

It would also be great if some of the search criteria available via the filter button could be made available elsewhere or featured more prominently. Perhaps this could be solved by making the filter button stand out better, rather than blending in with the background as much as it currently does.

This is a necessary restaurant app. Useful nationally. Works well with gps to immediately find restaurants in your area. I don't rely on the restaurant reviews; however for quick information as to nearby restaurants and access to photos and the restaurant's menu, this app is great. The best feature is to get a confirmed reservation. No more calling a restaurant only to show up to find your name is not on the list.

Easy to make reservations with the app. Very useful when in a new city and want to find an interesting restaurant. Areas for improvement: I've noticed that sometimes restaurant shows no available tables but if you call them they do in fact have availability. The most frustrating behavior is that after switching to another app and returning to this app, app goes back to start screen. Would be better if it recalled where the search was when last exited.

Don't not use this app, there are several other dining apps that actually follow through with crediting points to your account.  Had a 1,000 point table reservation and they did not credit the points.  Contacted customer service and they refused to credit the points even though I followed through with my dinner reservation and gave me a bs response.  After several email exchanges and not getting anywhere, gave up and downloaded restaurant.com app.  You'd figure after dropping $130 on dinner you could get a $10 credit!

2 stars, "Doesn't remember search in between tasks", by Smokemifugotem, for version 3.6, on May 20, 2012
Great application, but start a search and switch to another application and all the results are gone and you have to start over.  Get with the program and updat the functionality to multi-task.

5 stars, "Excellent", by Joexb, for version 3.6, on May 21, 2012
The one flaw is that you should be able to switch times and look for next available time while on a restaurant. The assumption sees to be that your time to eat is fixed and you are looking for a restaurant that can seat you at that time. I am usually more net rested in when I can get a tale at the restaurant I like: I can choose to go at another time.

2 stars, "Crashes on Map", by sffoodie11, for version 3.6.1, on May 22, 2012
This app makes searching very difficult. 1. You can't search by city, yes really (u less your are currently in the city, then you can search near you)
2. This glaring feature omission was made less miserable by the fact that you can search within a region on a map. I have many times tried to drag the map from one coast to another to find restaurants since you can't type in a city. This is a terrible user interface. In the most recent version, this feature is broken and the app crashes every time I try to recenter the map. Now I have no way of finding a restaurant in a city 20 miles away. 
3. This app was never updated for multitasking and if you leave the app (or it crashes) your search results are gone and you have to start the tedious process all over again.

*opentable is a great service but this app is terrible

Certainly the quick and convenient way to make a reservation at a favorite restaurant, but when we are looking for some place new, this is my app of choice. Recently we were driving home from an unfamiliar city and wanted to stop for dinner. I went right to open table and located several good places that were on the way. We picked one, based on its good reviews, and we had a great meal. I always use it when we are on vacation. Thanks open table!

I have used this app on my phone and I-pad for a couple of years.  It is so easy.  I can look at reviews of out of town restaurants and make reservations before I even leave home.

At the last minute, I can find a table without standing in line.

I have never had any problems.

No matter that you don't speak the language, it works worldwide. Oh I forgot you also get a bonus. You get a free Meal after a few reservations.

One evening as we were driving past Blackstone Steakhouse on Long Island, we decided to call to see if they had immediate availability (on a Friday night) and was told they were fully booked.... Unknowingly to them, I was also on the Open Table App on my IPAD which showed availability right at that moment.  Booked it, parked, walked right in and was seated within 2 minutes....NOT KIDDING?  Open Table is Amazing!!!!

4 stars, "Generally good, but why do I have to enter my phone # multiple times at confirmation", by The Glide 100, for version 3.6.1, on Jun 7, 2012
The site is very usual and generally extremely easy to use.  Only downside is that in confirmation you have to re-enter your phone again if you go to special requests or make any other change.

This is so easy to use and so efficient.  I was just able to book reservations 11 months in advance for college graduation celebrations. Reservations can be made 24 hours a day which makes it so easy.  We have gotten some great new restaurant recommendations from using the search options and it is very helpful to read reviews and see the menus. This is one of my top favorite apps.

I have been using Open Table before there were apps. O love being able to instantly make reservations. &amp; as a member you build points for a dining check. I like how the members can give their feedback. It is better than yelp in that you make your reservations from the app &amp; better than Zagat because you can see recent reviews $ it's a free app

Weirdly, the iPad version of this app does not feel as intuitive as the iPhone version.  It's baffling to me why it will only display possibilities in 20-restaurant increments.  And I always feel slightly baffled when presented with the home screen, especially if I need to change cities...

Love being able to search for nearby restaurants and see availability without making a bunch of phone calls.  This is a very handy app...

5 stars, "Great app!", by SweetieAzn, for version 3.7, on Jun 22, 2012
Seeing Lion King in NYC tomorrow and needed to find restaurants close to the show since my mom can't walk far distances. This app was awesome. Was able to filter my search to NYC- theatre district. Then I was able to see the address and where each restaurant was located on a map. The menu and other diner's reviews are also available to view. This is how I made a decision on which restaurant to choose in a sea of many! Really useful app and even better is that I can earn points for using it!

4 stars, "Open Table is Great.", by Bigdog401, for version 3.7, on Jun 24, 2012
Easy to use, and ease to find restaurants based on your current location. When traveling, or even when at home, it is easy to find a local restaurant and to see the availability for specific times. Some restaurants limit the availability, so if Open Table shows it not available, then you have to call directly. Only problem is then you do not get credit for a booking on OT. Otherwise it is fun to use. More establishments should wake up and get on OT because they are missing a broad group of diners who prefer to book it themselves online.

Love the functionality of the app. Great to be able to book restaurants so easily and the map feature is nice. It's very fast and intuitive.

Incredibly irritating that it erases your search as soon as you click out of the app even if it's supposedly running in the background. I often like to check out yelp and then go back to open table and every time i have to start from scratch. Other than that, it's a pretty good app.

4 stars, "Quick and easy to use", by stressqueen, for version 3.7, on Jul 1, 2012
App defaults to today with you standard party size which is fine. The editing of these takes a bit more time than seems necessary because of an iCalendar-type interface that requires each item be changed separately. There is still a neighborhood filter which is very useful bit this could use some enhancement as one cannot filter and have more than one neighborhood be visible - whereas the internet interface allows one to select more than one neighborhood.

Some filtering issues, and the ratings are difficult to determine quality (nearly every avg is the same).

This is a great app--make dinner reservations from your hotel room without calling all over town to see if anything is available.  We've been using Open Table for a couple of years and never once has our reservation failed to be correct and in place upon our arrival at the restaurant.  The reward--20 bucks after you dine umpteen times--is pretty stingy, but the convenience alone is well worth having this app in your pocket.

I'm disappointed with this app. I still use it, but every time I do I feel frustrated and that it could be better. Searching for a particular restaurant is what is especially frustrating. You can either search by name (but the app default to what is close by you at that moment) or by region (but then you ant search by restaurant, you can only see a full list of what is available at the day/time you want). So when you want to search for a particular restaurant that might not be close by to you when you are doing the search (as is often the case in major metro areas where you move around a lot) its incredibly frustrating.

5 stars, "A Diners Best Friend", by Vinoalvita, for version 3.7, on Jul 7, 2012
How did we make reservations before OpenTable?  I hardly remember. A useful source of not only who has tables available, but also what's being served and what other diners thought. An invaluable and easy to use tool. My only disappointment comes when a restaurant isn't listed or when there's a location not yet covered.

I love using Open Table and the new iPad app is very user-friendly.  I make reservations at least two or three times each week, so I've been up a ton of points.  Also, most restaurants take my requests for special seating requirements or other things that make going to a restaurant more special.  It's very helpful.

5 stars, "Awesome App...", by ase1707, for version 3.7, on Jul 10, 2012
This is the easiest as well as the most user-friendly app to have on your iPhone/iPad.  Making dining reservations is quick and simple, and the info as well as the reviews make it a necessary resource when trying to find a new place to eat.  This app makes for a compelling reason to own an iPad/iPhone.  In other words, this this the most used and most useful item on my iPhone/iPad.  If you travel, this app is way more important than Zagats, Yelp, Menu Pages, etc.  If there were 10 stars, I would give this app all ten!

This app is awesome. I use it every Saturday to quickly scan for available times. You can also make reservations at any time whether the restaurant is open or closed.  

When traveling I use it to find restaurants and read reviews and menus. 

The only change I would make is to expand coverage areas and keep adding restaurants. It's great!

5 stars, "Worth it!", by Jim H NYC, for version 3.7.1, on Jul 22, 2012
If you ever need to answer one of the following questions:

What restaurant close to here can seat us now?

What time can we get a reservation at Sullivan's on Saturday?

What was the name of that place on Saint Louis Street in the French quarter, and can we get a table tonight? (I'm thinking Antoine's, in case you were wondering.)

I've used OpenTable for all of the above. Case in point was a time when the first two places we checked had hour-plus waits, and we had a two-hour break for dinner. Oh, Tap House, around the corner, can take us now--let's go.  And they have 60 different beers on tap (well, they had better!).

Open table is the perfect tool for someone who finds them self in a different city almost every week and doesn't like taking risk with unknown establishments. If a Restuarant is connected to Open Table you can review it and make reservations with no trouble at all.

1 star, "Did not work at all!!!!!", by Efa1297, for version 3.7.1, on Jul 22, 2012
I downloaded this app several months ago. I used it for the first time last week.   I made 4 o'clock reservations at a restaurant I located through the app.  The reservations were made 7 days in advance. The day of our dinner plans we received a call from the restaurant, 4 hours before our reservation time, telling us they did not open until 5 o'clock. We had to scramble to find another restaurant to eat at.  This was the first and last time I will use this app.

I always check this app to make a reservation to eat! Easy to use it, plus we can get points. I even try to make a reservation 5mins before to get into the restaurant, just in case to get a table. I need more names of the restaurants on this app cuz sometimes I can't find my ideal restaurants.... That's sad!

5 stars, "What did we do before OT?", by Bichon Wheels, for version 3.7.1, on Jul 27, 2012
Oh yeah, we called and hoped the host/ess remembered to write it in the book! I wish Open Table had been around during my food service days. 

I enjoy reading the other customer reviews on dishes to try (or avoid!) and other insider tips. But honestly, the best part is being able to make reservations from my phone and know there won't be an issue when we arrive at the restaurant. It really is an excellent tool for diners, as well as restaurant staff. 

This app always works extremely well for me and I have to consult it frequently as I often make dining reservations for management. It's peace of mind!

I have been using Open Table for
about a year both at home &amp; when I travel.  It is so easy to find great restaurants as well as making reservations.  It nice to read the reviews before deciding where to eat when I'm out of town,  I have found some really great places &amp; look forward to going back on my next visit.
When writing a review I always include comments about the gluten free options since I have a gluten allergy.  I know how helpful it can be when choosing a restaurant.

5 stars, "Very goo app", by Dthompson024, for version 3.7.1, on Aug 5, 2012
I gave it 5 stars because it does everything I want it to do but one. Hopefully they will add the ability to create a calendar event from it, but it's free so you can't nitpick. This is great for all kinds of reservations. I travel frequently and it adjusts to wherever I am at.

3 stars, "Fashion stilist", by Nycharris, for version 3.7.1, on Aug 6, 2012
I think only people eat at the restaurant should be able to give reviews not because the place is noisy and busy give one star that is out jealous or pms so happen I like some restaurants .
And at list the places should have change to reply to some bad reviews invite tis people back to try again etc any case this is my point a lot other sites allows that and I think is more professional  
Please control that maybe at list you

4 stars, "App is great!", by baogden, for version 3.7.1, on Aug 8, 2012
Very easy to make reservations and even modify reservations if needed. The only issue I have (which may be the restaurant policy) is that reservation times may seem booked in open table app (meaning couldn't get time or increase number of people going) but when we get to restaurant there are empty tables for the entire time that we dine. I'm not sure if that many people really cancel last minute or if the restaurant only allows so many tables to be listed as available in open table.

Open Table takes the drudgery out of making dinner reservations. Also, a fantastic perk is the fact you actually get paid a nominal stipend for using the service regularly. Besides the convenience factor, Open Table has oodles of fact-filled info on all of the restaurants on the site. Who could ask for anything more? Bravo Open Table!

I have used Open Table for over 5 years and just recently started using the iPhone app. The app is easy and convenient. I prefer it to the website. I have used it to make 4 reservations in the last 3 weeks in 3 different cities. I thought I would not like the search function but I was easily able to find the restaurant I wanted. I will be using the app whenever possible!

5 stars, "Best way to become a regular", by St. Man, for version 3.7.1, on Aug 13, 2012
I am a restaurateur and have OT in all my restaurants. It's a fantastic way for us to make sure we take excellent care of our guests. As a diner I love having my dining record track. Hostesses and management change year in and year out. Booking through opentable captures your history so you don't have to start all over when the door changes. It pays to be a regular at a restaurant!

I have loved using opentable for my reservation needs! I've gone from Baltimore to Los Angeles to Miami and many places in between and it has been able to find me restaurants with accurate ratings (if people said they didn't like a place or said something was a negative - it was true). It didn't cost anything and it is super reliable. Love it! I would recommend it to anyone with an apple product who could use it.

5 stars, "Incredibly helpful!", by A.K.C., for version 3.7.1, on Aug 19, 2012
This app is so fantastic, I actually find it even better than the website. It is easy to navigate, easy to modify reservations. There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and business) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!

I made lunch reservations here expecting to have bland food and ok service. To my surprise I had just the opposite experience. Our server, Rosie, was very attentive. We had calamari and clam chowder for our appetizers, the soup needed a little salt n pepper. I had shrimp scampi for my entree and it was amazing. You ppl that say its not good are crazy!

I have been using Open Table for many years and have found that it always leads to a perfect evening. Open table allows restaurants to book accurately without never a very long wait for a table.

I was pleasantly surprised on a recent trip to London that Open Table has joined Top Table as a restaurant booking engine. What a pleasure it is than I can now book over 95% of my favorite restaurants online.

4 stars, "GREAT BUT LIMITED RESTAURANT OPTIONS", by DucatiDan, for version 3.7.1, on Aug 23, 2012
I've used OpenTable for years and love this easy to use app but it would be nice to have more restaurant options. I often find more restaurants available using Yelp that I'd rather dine with. OpenTable should explore other advertising options so that more restaurants don't feel it's an unnecessary expense especially in this current economic climate. If it means doing away with the points system to onboard more restaurants and have the convenience then I'm all for it.

5 stars, "a must have app if you love to dine", by autumnleaf22, for version 3.7.1, on Aug 23, 2012
if you use yelp, do not make a reservation with opentable thru yelp as it will not garner you with any points. 

other than that, the app is super easy to use and canceling is also a breeze. every time a birthday is mentioned the hostess or the waitress / waiter always acknowledges a special occasion. 

you can always make special requests under the comment section. excellent app!

OpenTable is great for finding a place in a strange city, and the app is well set up; I think it's easier to use than the OpenTable website on a full size computer.  Good integration with maps and telephone for finding the place and talking to them.

I have family and friends all over the US and when I visit, they usually ask, "where would you like to eat?" With cities changing so rapidly, it's great to have Open Table at my fingertips. I can find everything from the local haunts to the Michelin Star rated locales. It also keeps me abreast of the rapid changes occurring  in my own backyard. The dining points are also a welcome perk. I highly recommend this app.

We use this app at least weekly, more when we're traveling. We depend on the menus and reviews when searching out restaurants in both new and familiar cities. I'm still amazed when we can make a reservation as little as 15 minutes ahead and arrive to find people waiting up to an hour or more to be seated. I highly recommend it!

5 stars, "LOVE LOVE LOVE 😍", by Jets_Lover, for version 3.7.1, on Aug 31, 2012
I use this app CONSISTENTLY!!!! I have been a member since the start and it's fantastic! 

It's informational and also it now includes other diners reviews so it is definitely a determining factor when dining in or out.  It also provides info on new restaurants in the particular area of interest, and specifies cuisine and price point, if needed.

The points are a bonus which is like free residuals.

Thank you Open Table, for widening my horizons!😘

5 stars, "Open table review", by Amigo Juan, for version 3.4.2, on Aug 31, 2012
Open table is the easiest, most efficient way to make a reservation.  You have a great selection and there is no guesswork.
When I travel on business, I simply use my current location and it's done.  And it let's me link to the restaurant's website to get more information.  Probably the best app I have.

4 stars, "A Very Good App with a Couple of Weak Ppints", by DanReiss, for version 3.7.1, on Aug 31, 2012
The app is fast easy to use except for the location function. The user has to go through too many steps if it is different from the default. If I click on 'use my current location' the geographic scope is generally too broad. Often if I then specify a particular location the result is an error message; e.g., the closest metro area is . ..  But the geolocator knows where I am. Duh.

5 stars, "Great Asset", by Ackbar8, for version 3.7.1, on Sep 4, 2012
Have used this application for years, and it has been a big help. When in a strange town it is super to pull up what is available and also what is close. On a couple of occasions have tried to get in a restaurant as a walk-in and was told the wait was very long. Pulled up OpenTable, found an immediate opening at the same restaurant and hit confirm. Walked back to the Front desk, said I had a reservation, gave the name, they looked it up and lo and behold I was seated. How cool is that? This is definitely one of my favorite phone tools.

5 stars, "A must have app", by Bocafood, for version 3.6, on Sep 8, 2012
This app really makes the reservation process a breeze, especially if you are trying to find a restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for a Saturday night prime time reservation. The only heads p is that many restaurants only provide o pen table with a limited number of seats for their prime slots. Just because a time is unavailable on open table's schedule does not mean that the restaurant has nothing available at that time.

Wish all restaurants were part of the network. They would probably get our visit more often if they were because open table is the first place we go to when booking a reservation. If it's not there we move on to a choice that is.  We dine out at least three times a week and it has helped us with last minute decisions as well.

5 stars, "Love it...great for business travel", by Black Pond, for version 3.7.1, on Sep 10, 2012
Since I frequently take clients out for business dinners this app is great! It not only helps me to find a great restaurant close by to take a client to, I also earn points towards free meals I can use for me and my wife. The map built into the app is great for finding a restaurant in a particular area. I just wished more restaurants used their service. I just about won't go to a restaurant that doesn't allow me to book on OpenTable.

2 stars, "App is just OK", by Zachary M D, for version 3.7.1, on Sep 14, 2012
I think a lot of these reviews must be about Open Table in general. The website is great. The app is really lacking. You can't search by area other than near you or in one of their pre-configured zones. You can't search by cuisine other than nearby. Why limit it so much? Also, why no major updates, ever? Make it as functional as the website. I love Open Table, so I go to the app, get frustrated, then go to the website, every time.

Open Table app makes life so much easier. Only time it's difficult is when making a reservation for McCormick &amp; Schmick's - the name is so long I can't choose a location without going through each one. The long name situation is the only challenge other than that it's incredibly efficient. Thank you.

One of my most used apps! Could not live with out it! Tremendous time saver to determine what times are available in your current location. I love that it tells me what type of food and that I can easily see the menu, address, phone, and recent reviews. Makes life so much easier.  Especially valuable when traveling.  Especially when driving in an area that I am not familiar and hungry.  Open the app, plug in current location, it tell you the distance from where you are. Open table is an absolute must have!!!

1 star, "Left me hanging", by CoryBoat, for version 3.7.1, on Sep 15, 2012
I lost confidence in OpenTables service with my first use. I used OpenTable to make a reservation at an upscale restaurant called the Reserve in Philadelphia for my Wife's birthday last night. She has been wanting to eat there for awhile. However, when we arrived the restaurant was closed for a private party. What is the point of OpenTable and its reservation confirmation email if it's not true?! I didn't event receive a cancelation notice. OpenTable's credibility is lost with me, so I guess I'll stick to calling to make reservations in the future.

5 stars, "Opentable is a Must-Have App!!", by ScarsdaleLady, for version 3.7.1, on Sep 18, 2012
I frequently wait until the last minute to find a restaurant so I rely on Opentable to Find me a restaurant fast! The "use my location" popup on the app helps me faster than if I'd googled a search of restaurants. The reviews are the only way to know if the food is good &amp; the place worth the visit. I can't live w/o my Opentable! Plus, I am a "Points Junky"!! Why not get something for rating a restaurant?

4 stars, "Mostly fantastic!", by NashvilleNicole, for version 3.7.1, on Sep 20, 2012
I use this app religiously and love it. Wish I could post reviews (post-meal), still from the app, wish the phone numbers were on the restaurant screen (since sometimes they can squeeze you in by phone, instead) and that the menu links were always correct, but honestly, it's fantastic! I wish that when I modify the reservation, my notes remained saved rather than having to re-enter them each time (re: dietary restrictions, table preference, etc).
And! I wish I could search by restaurant name, regardless of where it's located, and be given city choices rather than say it's not recognized. I'd also really like to suggest restaurants for the app FROM the app. :) But I'm a crazy foodie all over the US...for most eaters, this app is very sufficient.

App is definitely great but can be better if:
1. if you can integrate maps with this to search the distance to wherever you are instead of coming out of this app and going to your maps and entering the address there.
2. If we can search the restaurant with a desired zip code or city instead of a pre-set selection.
3. If an option was created to send the restaurant(s) of choice to one of our friends or family so that they can view the restaurant(s) before making a reservation. 
Again great app but For now those mentioned above would make it excellent for me. Thank you.

I've been an Open Table devotee for years and the app is GREAT for making reservations on the go or at the last minute. They have most of the BEST restaurants online and the app ets you reserve those hard to book places the minute tables come online -- usually 30 days in advance. I hate to recommend this -- now i'll have a harder time getting a reservation!!!

Open Table is amazing and a must have app if you dine out more than once in let's say a life time! Restaurant reviews are generally reliable and most great restaurants are part of the Open Table family. I've been using Open Table for many years even before you could use via cell phone. I've never had a single issue with a reservation not being honored. Very convenient, free, and effective. What more could you want?

3 stars, "Good concept poor execution", by wa1oui, for version 3.8, on Sep 28, 2012
I like Open Table, it is an almost quick way to find restaurants. BUT it's a pain to use.  There's no way to ask for restaurants within a certain radius. Choosing each town one at a time is incredibly slow and frustrating. The app would be much more user friendly if I could ask for restaurants within a certain radius of a certain location.

The first time a friend pulled out her phone, when we were in a town that neither of us know well, to pick a place for our dinner that night, I was like, really??  Now I use it all the time, even for our favorite local places. I just wish even more restaurants were on there! Why wouldn't they be?

I travel a lot and cannot always bring along my gourmet laptop lists. This is a great tool, ESP where one tends to go someplace familiar rather than risk a "bad" meal.  Takes a lot of the guess work out and also puts new possibilities at your fingertips. Love it!

This app makes my weekends so much easier! Sometimes I can even get a reservation on Open Table when they tell me over the phone that they are booked or aren't taking reservations. Only warning... Make sure when you arrive you mention your OT reservation. I almost forgot to mention it once because they weren't busy anyway and the hostess was quite snotty about it.

I love this app - use it everywhere.  Just a few requests:
1.  There are a lot if great restaurants that don't use open table.  Add them!
2.  Wish I could see ratings before I click into the restaurant 
3. More pics!
4.  It's cumbersome to find restaurants near you in a map.  I always forget how to do it.  I eventually figure it out but there is something but intuitive about it.  

Otherwise - I love it!

3 stars, "Works, mediocre design", by Jamie Niemasik, for version 3.8, on Oct 19, 2012
Works fine and the new home screen is nice, though not particularly functional. Once you get past that veneer, you see that the app was not designed by someone who knows what they are doing: weird, poorly-placed buttons, selected / deselected colors so similar you can barely tell them apart, ugly list views, and so on. Not an app I would have on my phone if I had another option.

The other day, I was responsible for setting up a reservation for a large group and getting email invites out to the whole group...problem was, the restaurant didn't open until the late afternoon and I had to get the invites out before lunch. With open table, I reserved our seating and I didn't have to call in the moment the restaurant opened. Thanks for making an already incredible restaurant that much better!

Still needs to support more restaurants. I'm only able to make reservations with Siri and OpenTable about 20% of the time.

5 stars, "Convenient", by JsKorp, for version 3.8, on Oct 26, 2012
Fast, accurate, and convenient. Immediate confirmation is reassuring. Prefer to calling the restaurant. Only cons are that reviews are generally unhelpful, some places are not listed, and sometimes places are listed as full even when tables are available.

4 stars, "Best way to plan your evening", by Brian Karlak, for version 3.6, on Oct 27, 2012
Easy to use and accurate, great planning tool for a night out.  Only downside is that the review community is small, and the app resets location every time you switch between apps.

This app is a gem!   When the restaurant is telling you there's a 2 hour wait you can go on Open Table and reserve a table for as soon as 15 or 30 minutes from when you're looking.   It's fantastic.  And you accumulate points with every reservation that you can cash in for a $20 or $50 gift certificate.

I have used OpenTable for several years. It has made my life so much easier in making sudden short-term reservations as well as being able to plan for future dinners. It is so much easier than having to wait on the line and speak to individuals who are genetically predispositioned to having attitudes that may not be conducive to stress free telephone conversations. 
I am not sure that I have come to rely on their reviews but for that matter whose opinions can we trust anyway.

Thank you very much Open Table.

The Clay Pit never disappoints. The food is delicious and the wait staff competent. Often, my wife and I will go without a reservation and hang in the bar area while enjoying a cocktail. The bar manager has been there for ages and runs a tight ship. If you don't want to wait, make a reservation because this place is always busy. The noise level inside this historic brick building can sometimes detract from the otherwise cool ambiance, but if you can get a table in the small downstairs barrel-ceilinged cellar, it's much quieter.

I love open table! I travel all over the US and frequently bounce between NYC, Boston, New Orleans to Dallas.  It helps me make convenient and informed choices for dining.  It totally changed the variety of places I would have dined in. Since I am a consultant I need to find the best places for gathering with my entire team or just the clients.  I can never go back to having to call.

Device info: iPhone 4S, 64gb, OS 6.1, AT&amp;T, latest app update:
I'd love to like this app &amp;, as well, I'd love to use this app, BUT it will not work where I live. Not one single restaurant comes up. I live in Washington State, and we are the third largest area of the state and it doesn't work here. In this order, are the three largest areas: Seattle Area, Spokane Area, &amp; Tri-Cities (Pasco, Kennewick, &amp; Richland) Area, and neither Spokane not Tri-Cities is covered. Any updates coming soon to include these "lesser populated areas", dev?

5 stars, "Makes life easy", by Double Aja, for version 4.0, on Nov 14, 2012
Open Table is one of those apps that truly makes your life easier. It's never been simpler to make, change or cancel reservations. No need to call restaurants and last minute changes can often be accommodated. I just cashed in my first $20 rewards check and I hope more restaurants consider joining in!
Tips: always mark that the restaurant is your "first visit", chances are you'll get a better table. Some restaurants will not  make their larger tables available through the app, so a call maybe in order for a party of 5+.

It would be nice to have search parameters based on wether I am on a date or if I want to eat and celebrate. All in all, I love Open Table. If it was a beautiful woman I would marry her! ;-)

3 stars, "Delayed Start, and okay otherwise", by David Kohl, for version 4.0, on Nov 19, 2012
As a service, I love OpenTable. I probably book using the app or web interface 85% of all my lunch or dinner reservations. 

But the app itself is not a good as it should be. First, startup takes a solid 10 or 15 seconds on cellular network ... And sometimes longer ... Because the app seems to acquire your location and login to your account prior to giving the user control. It would be nice of the developers could do that in the background. It's especially frustrating when planning to reserve in another locale where current location is not relevant. 

Once beyond this annoyance, the app is fine. Utility is good and it's relatively easy to use. The iPad implementation is especially good given the extra large space for maps.

I eat out at least 8x a month in several cities - so Open Table really makes my life easier!  I love being able to see menus, check ratings &amp; availability at any time of day or night.    
It also helps that once you reach a certain # of booked tables you become a VIP, which the restaurants can see when you book. 
I also enjoy redeeming the Dining Reward checks that accumulate.   I've already redeemed (3) $50 rewards!

Great for finding local restaurants using a variety of criteria. Sometimes the location feature gets a little messed up and the proposed restaurants are a little further away then I would like. Something I like - booking on OpenTable gets you an email to submit a review for the restaurant a couple days following the reservation.

4 stars, "good app, couple of tweaks needed", by Sheffer12345, for version 4.0.1, on Nov 27, 2012
excellent app. just a couple tweaks:
1) make search national.  I don't want to have to spend 10 minutes remembering every time I travel that I have to manually enter the town in which I want to search a restaurant. 

2) wheel selector (date, credit card expiry, etc) should be able to click through to finish instead of hitting "done". then finish.  

besides that a great app.

5 stars, "Open Table App", by sailorjohnb, for version 3.7.1, on Nov 27, 2012
This is an essential tool for me. It takes a lot of the pain out of dining out. I really cannot think of any improvements to the format or fun toon of the app.

5 stars, "Great App!", by hugatree1715, for version 3.8, on Nov 27, 2012
No problems at all. I wish some restaurants were on here, but that's between the restaurant and OpenTable, not the app.

Seriously, how can you say anything bad about this?  You are in your city or visiting another.  You can find all the restaurants in your immediate vicinity and all their availabilities for a table that very night at that very instant.  A must have for foodies.

My wife and I have been using open table for years. We've used many of their $20 and $50 checks that were sent to us. It's almost like a game. Grab a 100 pts here maybe 1000 pts there. There's no reason not to try and add up your points for more checks. :)

5 stars, "Open Table Simplicity", by Clem55, for version 4.0.1, on Nov 29, 2012
I used to make a list of favorite, new and local restaurants and start dialing for availability. Weighed my options then called back to confirm only to find availability changed. Open Table lays out all local restaurants, times available and links to menus and reviews. Simple and fast with all the information I need. Only downside is I tend to eat out more often - trade offs!

5 stars, "Great way to reserve", by Ajm94618, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 1, 2012
My only recommendation for improvement is, when one wishes to change a reservation to a new location, they be allowed to secure the reservation first before being required to cancel the old. It could be done on a single page perhaps so that the old one is indeed cancelled.

I use this app very often, often also in conjunction with Yelp.
Like the ease of use but I wish I could multi-select when filtering, e.g., neighborhoods - that would really really improve the usability.

5 stars, "Love love love this App", by CJinWI, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 3, 2012
If you are metropolitan areas, this is the most useful tool. I would like to see lesser populous cities put on the map and their salespeople to be a little more vigilant in terms of spreading their coverage, but still a wonderful tool when visiting unknown areas, or if you just want a change of pace. App itself works beautifully. Confirmation emails are immediate, and cancellations or last minute reservations a breeze...

Super easy to use. They finally figured out how to make the app stay where you left it with reservation searches so you can answer phone calls or whatever and not have to redo your search. Still some work to be done with the interface. There's some things that are not as easy to use as they should be...

5 stars, "A Regular Part of Life", by Ashjete, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 5, 2012
Open Table is really the only way I make reservations in Seattle ... I don't even think about calling restaurants any more and it's the rare exception that a place uses another system. The app just does it all!  It's also ideal for last minute reservations or finding a new place to try.
It always surprises me when other cities aren't quite as integrated with it, but we've still used if for places everywhere from the suburbs of San Francisco to the heart of New York City.
The best way to summarize: it's a regular part of my life. I'd almost forgotten what it was like to call around...

Making the reservations takes less than a minute, and you get an immediate confirming email.  Revising or canceling the reservation is just as easy.  The icing on the cupcake is accumulating points that eventually earn you dining points.  This is the best of the dining apps.

Someone is in need of a map. Roanoke is in western Virginia, not West Virginia. WV became a state in 1863, and yet a city from another state is listed for a place to eat in 2012.  Good work.

5 stars, "So Convenient", by La Princessa 77, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 10, 2012
I've loved the Open Table concept since it started and having an app where you can go to one place and quickly find what's available and reserve is such a convenience. Occasionally I'm disappointed a restaurant isn't on it but I fault the restaurant for that, not OT.

5 stars, "Advantages of open table", by Steve the foodie, for version 4.0, on Dec 10, 2012
Open table beats the typical 
Reservation Systems by a long shot. Most of the other rest finder sites are a crapshoot. Switch to open table for the best experience. Plus tell the management u r an open table subscriber. I have received free drinks and desserts just by mentioning open table. Chefs and owners know the open table subscribers are more savvy and will write reviews that drive in other diners.

4 stars, "Very good", by FoodieMike, for version 4.0.1, on Dec 10, 2012
A great way to find available restaurants and conveniently make reservations. I've tried new restaurants because I discovered them on Open Table. I wish they included the address on the initial list. I hate scrolling over a page to find out where the restaurant is.

I use this app for all of my reservations and have never had a problem with it. Only downside is when the restaurant's system won't allow a particular reservation time - then there's an extra step of calling the restaurant to try to get the time you want, but this is not a usual occurrence.

I like the opentable concept, but it's not very reliable. I often get errors that say "unable to connect to server" when trying to make a reservation. I then have to go onto the website to make a reservation. 
It would be really helpful if opentable could automatically add an appointment in my calendar when I make a reservation.

The first time I used this app was interesting. I walked into a Garces restaurant (Iron Chef) without reservation and told that there was a 2 hour wait for a table. I stepped out of the restaurant, booked a table via Open Table, walked in back inside 5 minutes after, and gotten a table in less than 15 minutes. Funny to see the face of the hostess who minutes ago, had told me I had to wait 2 hours.

5 stars, "Why talk to humans?", by Torresiki dude, for version 4.0.2, on Dec 14, 2012
Why talk to humans when you can go online and make a reservation. Vending machines have been here for a while and i think making a reservation is far easier than fetching a cold drink. Plus there are places that are hard to get in on short notice and opentable has "open tables". The points are a plus.

You'll never get put on hold again or get voicemail because the hostess is not in. Reverse at 2 am while taking a dump on your iphone.

2 stars, "Buggy update", by uncertainage, for version 4.0.2, on Dec 17, 2012
I've long relied on this app despite its pared-down functionality. But suddenly,  it's begun giving me a red message that says "A phone number is required" — though I've always had a phone number in my profile. And it now regularly pops up a "cannot connect to server" box. The Modify function is especially buggy. What's up with these new problems?

3 stars, "Nearly perfect", by Gerald Guerra, for version 4.0.2, on Dec 17, 2012
Though it's not any fault of Open Table, to be able to make a reservation and have the restaurant not keep its end of the bargain (fulfilling the requested time) kind of defeats the purpose of this app. Maybe Open Table can incorporate reservations already maintained by the restaurant(s) in question. Great concept though.

5 stars, "#1 reason to carry a smartphone", by handy G, for version 4.0.2, on Dec 17, 2012
Opentable is my go to app for anytime I dine out. If the restaurant is not here I won't go. Works well to find all the great places to dine. Reviews from users very helpful in addition to the menus. And I get a check every few months from opentable. Wow!!

Open Table is a life saver. I use it to search by ratings, locations, and every other feature and book my reservation all from my iPhone. Easy, fast and reliable. Can email to others, add to calendar, map location, make changes, contact restaurant, etc. on the go. 

This is a must app!

1 star, "Used to be amazing. Something majorly wrong now", by Add11sd, for version 4.0.2, on Dec 18, 2012
I use opentable almost once a week... But whether it's my new iPhone 5 or the new upgrade, there is a serious mobile glitch. It now won't make a reservation saying "phone number required" even though my phone # is in the system and the desktop version does the same reservation seamlessly. However, I usually make reservations on the go, so problem with the mobile app is not good. Please, fix it!

4 stars, "Easy to use", by JNachod, for version 4.0.2, on Dec 19, 2012
Love how reservations sync between iPad, iPhone and my computer.  On occasion a restaurant I dine at will "cancel" my reservation rather than acknowledging my visit - forcing me to fill out a few forms to avoid being dinged with a no show.  I suspect this is because restaurants think they can save the $1 fee that they have to pay for honored reservations.  However, this problem is rare and not really a big deal to me.

This is a great app and super convenient when scheduling dinner reservations - no more waiting till a place opens to call, no potentially surly hostesses to talk with, and you can see other time availability just in case you need that flexibility. I use it all the time, even with restaurant's I'm a regular at when I know they are busy.

We've been using Open Table for a few years now and found it a very convenient and reliable way to find and secure reservations for places to eat no matter where we are. Have only been burned once by a restaurant who didn't know we had a reservation, but that was their fault. The mobile app itself leaves nothing to be desired, it works great. Have not gotten to cash in any "rewards" we supposedly get though, so I'm a little skeptical about that portion. But it's still a great app, I use it so often it's on my Home Screen.

This app is great and much easier that calling a bunch of places.  I use it all the time to make reservations and love it.  My only request is that the get better restaurant coverage.  Lots of times I'll start in Yelp and then go to Open Table to make the reservation because the don't have as many options.

I rely on it all the time for reservations and it works well. My main complaint is that it doesn't show any info at all on restaurants not connected with opengable's reservation system, so I have to use some other app to browse "all" restaurants in an area, pick one, and THEN see if it's reservable via opentable.

Open Table is one of those must-have apps when you're living in a big city. It's connected to a lot of restaurants (the good ones too) here in SF so the app will be very useful. Moreover, it's also linked with Yelp so you can make reservations using Open Table from Yelp. Very convenient app!

I use Open Table all the time and downloaded the app while on a trip to Florida to make a reservation while I was out and about. It worked great and I've been using it ever since. I've never had a problem with a reservation, and the app makes it super easy. I also love the Open Table points--I just recently used $40 of Open Table certificates, which I redeemed through the app. The restaurant treated them like cash.

4 stars, "Great app and a great service", by lmv09, for version 4.2, on Jan 2, 2013
App works fairly  well on iPad and iPhone.

Need to fix problem of not including phone number of restaurant when sending the confirmation to email or calendar.

One common problem is that closing hours are often WRONG. About one in every ten post-9pm reservations we make cannot be honored because restaurant closes earlier than Open Table says it closes.

I'd like to see functionality to be able to get directions from the restaurant to another place so I don't have to leave the app to see how far it is from one place to another.

Also I don't like that you can't do your reviews on the app.

I do however mostly love Open Table and find the app very convenient!

2. If the display of the restaurants what vertical instead of on a carousel. 
3. If we could search by food type i.e. Chinese.

4 stars, "Required app - esp for travelers", by KEB216, for version 4.2, on Jan 6, 2013
For the current Open Table fan, the mobile app is an imperative.  For those not already using it, Open Table is a handy way to find and book tables, particularly useful when you're out of your own 'hood. 

For a fifth star:  the neighborhood filter could be improved in NYC, SFBA and other large metros. Search areas are currently either too broad ("Silicon Valley)" or too narrow ("Sunnyvale").  In smaller metros with lower restaurant density, it works well.

4 stars, "Top Go-To App", by eportzline, for version 4.2.1, on Jan 10, 2013
Open table gets a solid 4 stars, maybe 4.5. It's a great way to find restaurants, both new and favorites, book tables, and read reviews. I find the reviews to be far more reliable than Yelp, because you can only rate and provide feedback for a restaurant of you've dined there. 

Among the few and rare issues: some connectivity issues have existed, but they don't usually persist. Before the update, the app would occasionally crash, and while it's better, it still tends to crash, particularly when you're reviewing a restaurant menu.

Still, this app is highly recommended.

Great atmosphere!!! Pulsating with music but chill atmosphere at the same time.  Drinks are awesome.  I'd give it 5 stars except I wish there were more vegetarian dishes.  I know it's a Cuban restaurant (I'm Cuban) but there are wonderful inventive vegetarian dishes that can be made with a Cuban flavor.  We always eat the sides and appetizers and they're great!!!
Great place for a date or to hang out with friends.

Fast and easy use on the go.  Deep list of restaurants we like to frequent. Recent example where this app has saved me is when I dropped my elderly mom and sister off at the door of a restaurant where we wanted to have brunch.  The hostess told them they would not be seated for at least 45 minutes because we did not have a reservation.  My sister texted this to me as I parked the car and within 60 seconds I was able to book the reservation on my iPhone.   We were seated immediately when I walked in to join them.  I love this app!!!

4 stars, "Easy and effective", by RMcD PDX, for version 4.0.1, on Jan 28, 2013
Works well as long as you accept that not all restaurants are included-only those that subscribe. Fast if your in the go at your home town, but even better when your out if town and not familiar with what's around you, what's available, and how good it is. Also reliable - I've never had a reservation confirmed with the app that the restaurant didn't also recognize.

4 stars, "Very useful", by WestEndGal, for version 4.2.1, on Jan 29, 2013
While this app is extremely useful, I find that it is a little "bossy" as it always wants to use your current location and I seem to have to go thru a few "extra" screens/steps to simply choose the location I specified in "search". A tad buggy - but when you get to the desired page, info well laid out and very useful

Love this app. It's incredibly easy to use especially when needing last minute reservations and traveling. The descriptors are pretty good &amp; the menus are usually up to date.  Downside is has some chains (I don't like chains) but misses a lot of smaller independent mom &amp; pops.  Also, a lot of places want you to call for larger parties, like 6 persons which defeats the point.  Overall, totally worth the effort for ease of use.  The new design is great too.

4 stars, "Nice application and service.", by Geezy G, for version 4.2.1, on Feb 1, 2013
Great way to generate points. And an easy easy way to get reservations at any place in the city. My only complaint: they should make the more points you gather worth incrementally more for the bonus checks. Why save up my points for a $50 check, when I can redeem 20,00 points for $20.

I use this all the time and love it. I do wish the price tags were more accurate - there are quite a few places that are much pricier than listed (i.e. a place that does small plates is going to seem cheaper per plate but its typically 2-3 plates per person).

4 stars, "Good for major cities", by JRGottschalk, for version 4.2.1, on Feb 1, 2013
Living in Chicago, this is a great app for reservations and getting occasional perks from using this app for reservations. In smaller cities, Open Table doesn't have many participants, so it's not as useful.

This app is great, I use it all the time when I want to go to a nice restaurant. Most of the time I make a last minute reservation, and by the time I get to my destination, I don't have to wait long.
The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because there are still a lot of restaurants I like not available.

I've been using Open Table for several years, and it is just about perfect. It's incredibly easy to make a reservation on the fly. The only downsides that I see are more related to the restaurants: it'd be nice if more restaurants participated in Open Table, and not all of the menus are available or accurate. Otherwise it is pretty much spot on!

I love open table and how it can be soooo EASY make a reservation. Two suggestions: The phone number on the front screen would help a lot.  Also it is hard to find some locations.  They are located under odd titles.  I would rather enter in a city and see all with a given radius.   Ie I found it hard to find Princeton NJ - which is under NewYork and tri counties and then under Central NJ and then blended with a wide area

This is a really great app to use for making dinner reservations. It's especially helpful when you're not exactly sure what restaurant you want to go to – OpenTable will show you the restaurants that have tables available. If you do know what restaurant you want, OpenTable is such a fast easy way to make your reservations. Thanks for the great app!

2 stars, "Why can't I just enter a city!?", by Holmstar, for version 4.2.1, on Feb 4, 2013
While the app works great if you're using current location, I work 30 miles from home.  If I'm making a reservation, I'm most likely going to be doing it earlier in the day (at work), for a restaurant near my home.  The app won't allow you to enter a specific smaller town without also searching for the name of a specific restaurant.  I don't want the whole north metro.  Why oh why can't I enter the name of my home suburb without searching for a specific restaurant!?  Really annoying!

5 stars, "Love Open Table", by Hovenn, for version 4.2.1, on Feb 4, 2013
Great app. Saves time. Easy to use. I used to hate calling for reservations, it was always too early, too late, wrong number. Now I can make reservations when I want to. Love it! I also like reviewing restaurants, I can give feedback that I don't always feel comfortable giving.

1 star, "Critical bug makes this unusable", by Dhzk, for version 4.3.0, on Feb 10, 2013
Cannot complete a reservation because the keyboard covers up the "Next" button. No matter what I do I cannot move the keyboard or slide down enough to tap the button. On the iPhone 5 this is not an issue since the screen is long enough, but it makes this app completely worthless on an iPhone 4. Please fix!!

5 stars, "Can't live without it", by Ngarcez, for version 4.3.0, on Feb 10, 2013
The most useful app in my phone. Easy to use, easy to get a reservation done in less than 10 SEC in the best restaurants in NY and Chicago. Wish they would also offer a rating for the restaurants from a independent source (may be a tie-up with Zagat/Google?) and not only from their own customers.

1 star, "Terrible!", by Easties15, for version 4.3.0, on Feb 10, 2013
This app is terrible. We have literally hundreds and hundreds of dining places around here especially being so close to two of our major cities in CT. This app doesn't find any places in some of our most popular cities where it's near impossible to get reservations on a Fri or Sat. Don't download of you are from CT, you will spend more time sifting through places in NY

I wish every restaurant had options to reserve via Opentable because this app is the easiest possible way to make a reservation. Enter time, date and restaurant name &amp; go! Or just go by your location and pick a nearby restaurant. It's incredibly simple &amp; I've had no issues with it. Doesn't hang or crash on you. I highly recommend it!
--
2 stars, "Good, but....", by TAH1121, for version 4.2.1, on Feb 12, 2013
The app itself is good when it works. If there is an update to the app and you haven't updated it yet, then it doesn't work until you update it. Also, it should tell you before signing up, that you will receive spam emails everyday, and I mean everyday from OpenTable. Emails regarding contests, upgrade points, double your points. Really? I just want to find a nice place to eat without all the nonsense. Sending an email once a week is plenty, not everyday. That is why I gave it two stars, if you cut the email to once a week, I'll give five stars.

I use the Open Table app as much as possible.  My husband and I encourage restaurant owners to join because its convenient for customers to make a reservation days in advance. We also believe this has to aid the owners regarding staffing and menu options. Not only do we use the app in our hometown but always for out of town restaurants too. For my husbands birthday I was able to add a special request at the time I was making the reservation. We were blown away at the service that we received simply by letting them know it was his birthday. I highly recommend this app and hope you do too!!!

5 stars, "So easy and quick..,", by jgcjgc, for version 4.2.1, on Feb 16, 2013
...and I swear we get better service at the restaurants when I use OT compared to calling directly?? Seems weird since the restaurants pay for that reservation. Maybe they share a little data on the customer? I don't mind if they keep track of who is a good customer....

Wish I could search in a more specific area easier. Seems to take a lot of clicking to narrow it down, if you can.

4 stars, "Perfect app", by boconnell, for version 4.3.0, on Feb 17, 2013
Wish all restaurants were on this app.

Update 2/16/2013: Open Table had a massive failure on Valentine's Day. At no less than eight top restaurants in Houston, it was offering tables that were simply not available. The first place cancelled my reservation overnight, and then I made another, last minute, and called to follow up directly with the restaurant. No table. Tried six others, same story (table available on OT, but not in reality. The cherry on top of this was that I got a no-show notice from OT on the second reservation!!!!! Beware of OT on special occasion-nights. Fortunately, there are less than a handful every year, so the other 360 days are fine. Docking them one star because of this experience.

I love using Open Table!  Not only does it make it easy to choose a great restaurant at a moment's notice, you can read reviews, see menus and get directions.  I use it at home and while traveling.  I only wish every restaurant was on it!!  And added bonus are the points earned, although I have yet to use my points.

3 stars, "Works great if you know the restaurant you want to go", by Sleepytime NYC, for version 4.3.0, on Feb 19, 2013
Is a joy to use once you know the restaurant you want to go to, but trying to find a place with this app leaves a lot to be desired. You can't search for more than one cuisine (ex: I want French OR Italian), neighborhood, or price point, and you can't search any of the useful tags that they keep (ex: I want "fit for foodie" restaurant with a less than "energetic" noise level and service above 4 stars). You're better off searching somewhere else and coming back to make the res.

5 stars, "My go to for Reservations!!", by Efitol, for version 4.3.0, on Feb 19, 2013
Easy site to use with great reviews.  Wherever I am traveling, I always use open table to make the reservation after reading the reviews.  If the restaurant isn't on open table, I don't eat there regularly.  Was recently in Vegas and was hungry for seafood. In a matter of minutes, we found an 4 star restaurant, made reservation and had a 5 star experience!!

I use it several times a week to snatch a table at all the best restaurants.  It saves us hours of calling around to see who has an opening at lunch or dinner. 

It also quickly ends debates about where we want to eat, cause we can easily see who has an Open Table when we are looking...

I would like to see more reviews, and ideally a tie in to Yelp, so I could see the restaurants Yelp rating right on the open table search page.   This would save me a lot of time flipping back and forth between apps, especially when I am traveling to a new city.

Was looking for dinner on a very busy night with long lines everywhere. I downloaded OpenTable and found that one of my favorite (and very busy) restaurants somehow had a reservation available within 15 minutes. Luckily I was only 2 minutes away so I drove over and went inside. The people ahead of us were told 60-70 minute wait. I gave my name and waited for the hostess to show some kind of confusion but all they did was seat us!  Wow. I know I likely got lucky and took a spot that someone else just cancelled, but there's no way that could have been done without OpenTable!

Open Table is an easy-to-use program for making restaurant reservations. I use it regularly. It isn't as easy as it could be to make reservations for a very short time in the future, like fifteen or twenty minutes out. It's possible, but has to be done through a series of "backwards" time modifications. 
It takes a lot of restaurant visits to accumulate enough points to be of any use. But it is nice to be able to make spur-of-the-moment reservations.

I needed to check availability for a restaurant at 10am, before the restaurant answered their phones. Within a few minutes I checked reviews, availability and confirmed my reservations for later this evening. I'm glad I had it on my phone.

If you travel, OpenTable is a must. It's simple to use and a great way to find new favorite restaurants. I've used both the desktop and iPhone version for years and never had a problem. I just wish membership for restaurants was more affordable so that the non-urban choices were broader.

5 stars, "The Best!", by Harry the Doc, for version 4.3.0, on Feb 24, 2013
Open Table reservations are transmitted instantaneously to the selected restaurant.  Two days ago our party arrived at a Manhattan restaurant without a reservation -- we had inadvertently made a reservation at a different restaurant of the same chain.  The host canceled our original reservation and asked me if I would like to rebook at his location via Open Table so we could pick up the points.  When I made the reservation on my iPhone he had it in hand within ten seconds and proceeded to seat us for a wonderful dinner.  Thanks to Del Frisco's and to Open Table!

5 stars, "Easiest reservation app", by Massdaw, for version 4.3.0, on Feb 25, 2013
Easiest app I've seen for doing reservations. Best if doing one close to your location. Not quite as easy as the web site if you are looking for a restaurant away from where you are, especially in a big city (for example, it gives you all Manhattan). Still, beats calling multiple restaurants. I have found that if you really want a restaurant and the app says it's sold out, a call can get you a table.

Easy to use.  Allows you to add special requests such as disabled seating, special setup such as ice buckets for wine and even your favorite servers area.   I just wish more restaurants would join open table. Urge your favorite place to join once you find you really like using it.

This App is wonderful. You can stand in a restaurant &amp; have the hostess to tell you that there will be over an hour wait. And while standing there you can open up Open Table &amp; book a reservation right there on the spot &amp; have your name called within minutes!!! It happened to me in a very popular, very busy restaurant in D.C.  It works!

This app makes it so easy to make reservations. If you know the restaurant you want you type it in and see reservation times available. If you're looking for a restaurant it shows you dozens close to your home. Then once you book they send you an email to remind you of your reservations. Fabulous!!

As an extremely busy working Professional and mother of 4 kids, this is such a life saving tool. I can make reservations late at night when I actually have time to make them, but the restaurants are closed. Saved me from having to take time out of my day to call the restaurant. Also great to have all my reservations in one convenient location. Thank you, for making my life a bit easier.

This a awesome app. I wish that more restaurants would adapt to this program. For me it all I need.  I like that I can make reservations a few weeks in advance. The only complaint is not for open table but 1000 point restaurants are not the best selection. I am sure that its up to the restaurants who are slow to make the available.  So 5 ⭐ for me.

2 stars, "Coming short", by Amc sf, for version 4.3.0, on Mar 2, 2013
The app works very good but with one big difference with online, that the app does not give the 1000 point restaurants and I have seen multiple times a difference with the online version; unacceptable if you create an app. Also, I do miss the ratings for restaurants in the app while that is exactly what you need when you travel and don't know the area.

5 stars, "Only way to go out to eat!", by Brian128, for version 4.2.1, on Mar 2, 2013
One of the best apps/ideas ever. Been using this site since the month it started years ago long before iPhones came out. It was great then, better now! They add more and more restaurants all the time, from high end to low end. And the whole issue with the 1000 points thing; it's not offered for all the restaurants all the time. It's meant for low foot traffic ones. So please ignore those who complain about thus and give a negative review because if their ignorance. This is the only way to dine, plus THEY PAY YOU to use it (eventually) by cashing in points. What more can you ask for?

5 stars, "Nice app", by kmartin7, for version 4.3.0, on Mar 2, 2013

I am an advocate of OpenTable, I use this app all the time.

4 stars, "Only minor reservations ...", by A robot with tired eyes, for version 4.2.1, on Mar 4, 2013
I do wish the restaurant's phone # was supplied in the confirmation email, so that if you have to change your time or cancel, you don't need a new screen.

Overall, a great app in a city with many restaurants. Better user interface than most, pretty fair range of restaurants. I'd be list without it, actually.

4 stars, "Great App, but...", by wehayley, for version 4.3.0, on Mar 5, 2013
This app is wonderful when it comes to it's main purpose - making reservations. However, a big part of the system seems flawed. I have praised several restaurants here, and those reviews always post. But every time, I've fairly knocked a restaurant, for whatever reason, those reviews somehow seem to never appear. What's up with that?
--
5 stars, "Excellent", by Texas Flier, for version 4.3.0, on Mar 5, 2013

4 stars, "Convenient and almost perfect", by PeruCRMex, for version 4.3.0, on Mar 5, 2013
The Open Table app has a great design except for its preference for using location services and "finding" you a reservation. I always go to the app with a specific restaurant in mind and am irritated by the constant interruption of the error message saying the app can't find my current location. I don't want or need it to find my current location. Other than this, the rest of the app is well formatted and works well.

My favorite app for finding a good place to eat. I travel every week for work and like to try good local establishments. Open Table takes the guess work out of finding a good clean place to eat. Before Open Table, it was a crap shoot on where to eat as you never know what eatery you were walking into. Open Table takes the guesswork out of the equation. Thanks Open Table!  Oh, and you get points to boot!

5 stars, "Perfect!", by xMontaigne, for version 4.3.0, on Mar 7, 2013
I am sure there are ways it can be "improved," but think about what life was like before open table, and I'm not just referring trying to find the right place to eat while traveling. For example, I just made a reservation for an important dinner in a few days in my home town while sitting in a noisy bar. It took about a minute. I knew where I wanted to go and had promised She Who Must Be Obeyed that I would make a birthday dinner reservation this morning (and forgot). No looking up a number, no way to talk on the phone here anyway. A few taps on the smart phone and voila! it's safe to go home tonight. It's even more useful when I'm traveling. Perfect. Bravo!

I recently used OT in NYC and having been a long time user, I was dismayed at the less efficient access and added steps to make a reservation using the updated app. Nonetheless I value the service and wonder if the bugs are being worked out so that the added steps for transition from screen to screen are easier or more clear!

I love this app. What a great way to make reservations at your favorite restaurants. The only problems I have seen are that the reviews tend to overrate the restaurants; I wish there was a way to review the reviewers, or find reviewers who gave reviews similar to yours so that you could get a more accurate reading of whether reviewed restaurants were really up to your liking. But other than that the service is fantastic. I adore OpenTable.

2 stars, "Poor no show policy", by micheleleeelle, for version 4.4.0, on Mar 12, 2013
Love the app. Actually many restaurants use Open Table exclusively for taking reservations. I find it very convenient to use. 

So it came as quite a surprise when our first night of vacation I found out account is suspended!  We had one no show ever. It was a mistake and I tried to cancel using the link in the email but could not remember my password at that moment. 

Their Open Table policy states at four no shows in 12 months they will suspend the account. 

I did get an email and it even said if we really were a no show we did not have to do anything. 

Hay programmers make it easier to cancel a reservation in the mobile app. 

Hay open table please unsuspend my account.

This is one of my most-used, most-loved apps! I love that Open Table makes reservation making easy and convenient. You can see when a table is available at your restaurant of choice or you can search by the time you'd like to eat and it will find a restaurant for you! Running late? If you need to change your reservation, you can do so within 10 minutes of your original reservation via the app. Plus, every reservation you make gives you points towards a gift certificate! Love that! It makes my life easier and rewards me for it!

5 stars, "Love the app!", by Gcarter101, for version 4.4.0, on Mar 13, 2013
When most people are trying to call in for reservations, you can simply ask Siri for a reservation and it works cleanly.

A time, number of guests, and location work best, but if you want to just guess, a restaurant is not necessary.  It helps you find a great restaurant even if all you know is a time and your current location.

So far it has not let me down.

I have been using open table more than 3 years.  It is one of my Top 5 apps. Whenever I'm in a new city  or neighborhood I rely on open table to help me find what I'm looking for.  I never worry that I will show up and find a restaurant closed or booked. I especially like to try new restaurants right under my nose that I never knew existed.
The only negative is the lock out of prime seatings by some restaurants.

5 stars, "Always there when I need it", by Bfdynasty, for version 4.4.0, on Mar 13, 2013
The OpenTable app is extremely convenient. I use OpenTable on my phone more than on my computer. It's extremely quick and gives me the ability to make last minute reservations or to easily make a reservation as soon as the thought arises. I don't use it every day, but I'll always have it on my phone for when I need it.

5 stars, "Great for last minute availability", by Janelle Montgomery, for version 4.3.0, on Mar 13, 2013
This app in a couple of clicks will find you a reservation nearby. It's actually easier to use than the we-based service. Only thing I don't like is the reviews are overly rosy, but that's the reviewers' fault. Just take them with a grain of salt.

4 stars, "Great app", by HungryJacq, for version 4.4.0, on Mar 14, 2013
I've used OpenTable for probably 10 years or so and find it to be one of those things that makes my life much easier. Over the years they've added menus for the restaurants so you can truly make an informed decision on where you'd like to eat. The app itself has much of the functionality if the website, though not all. Noticeably lacking is the ability to search by address. Having said that, if you know where the address is, you can change the map settings to look in a particular area. This of course, requires you to have some familiarity with the places where you dine, but since I also use OT when I travel, I don't always know where things are in advance. And who knows, maybe that will be possible with their next release.

Remember when your smart phone was new and you were mystified that it could do so many magical things? This was one of the apps that really got me. I can make a reservation at a restaurant without calling and talking to anybody, and I can check their availability myself? What?!

Anyway, this app still works magically and they keep adding new tweaks that make it more pretty and functional. M only complaint is that not all restaurants use it. Otherwise, this is my go to when making reservations for special occasions.

5 stars, "Most useful app", by themendozaline, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 17, 2013
I love the Open Table app.  So easy to find and make reservations, whether local or when traveling to an unfamiliar area.  This is probably one of my most used, and most useful apps.  It would be great if you could also list restaurants that don't take reservations and perhaps have them post current wait-times or availability via the app.  I'm sure restaurants would pay for this service, especially if they could post no-wait during slower periods of the day.

Not much more to say. App functions flawlessly and super convenient. It's my go to for reservations. I suppose I would like to be able to filter before an initial search, but that's a minor quibble. It takes me 30 seconds to solve what could be a cumbersome problem. Lots of choices. I've never had an issue.

4 stars, "Very convenient and improving", by mitorez, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 20, 2013
If the restaurant is listed, this app is very convenient to make a reservation - even last-minute. The app UX is much improved, now that some iPhone 5 only display items are making it to 4S.

Suggestions:
1. Filter for BYO restaurants.
2. Move Facebook button to bottom of profile page - because I don't want to logon to Facebook and the giant button is in my way at the top of page.

4 stars, "Simple, convenient app", by Dave1949, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 20, 2013
Open Table is almost a necessity in an urban area for dining out.  It gets you into great restaurants quickly.  An unforgettable incident in Tampa: a friend and I were walk-ins at an upscale restaurant with a waiting line.  The hostess said there was a 30 minute wait. While she was distracted momentarily by another guest, I used OpenTable to make and confirm a reservation got right then. When she turned back, I just said I believed I had a reservation, she glanced at her computer, said "yes, you do", and we were seated immediately!  
Only downside: some very good and less expensive restaurants do not use the App - probably because they are charged.  So restaurants tend to be on the expensive side.  One misses out on local places that are very good and often much less expensive.

Only complaints are that I wish you could navigate a city's restaurant that you are NOT currently in to make a reservation and I've got a lot of points and want to get my dinner coupon but they do not make it easy to find out how to redeem the points.
Update: still love open table but still no idea how to redeem points.

Love this app and the service in general. It's helpful and informative. I love being able to see all the open reservation times.
My only regret is that more restaurants don't use it.  Frustrating that it's not more ubiquitous.
I would also like to be able to rate/review restaurants, or at least have a link out to Yelp! or something.

Just use it and it will speak for itself. In NYC it's hands down the best app for making (and changing reservations). 

One suggestion for OpenTable - several restaurants call to confirm the day before and require a phone call back to keep the reservation. This can be a pain to call hem back. I'd rather "confirm" via the app.

I've been an Open Table user for years. Great for finding restaurants in new cities. Customer reviews are very helpful. Only problem with the app is minor. When I log in it always asks if I want it to remember my log in info, but it never does.

4 stars, "Great app", by Toc2112, for version 4.4.1, on Mar 30, 2013
I really get a lot of use out of this app.

My only negative is that very frequently it'll say restaurants won't have the available time you want, but if you call the restaurant directly, it'll be available.

Not only do they have the time available, but there's plenty of empty tables.

5 stars, "The Perfect App", by YogieZ, for version 4.4.1, on Apr 1, 2013
Apps often over promise and under deliver.  OpenTable does exactly what it is supposed to do, and makes restaurant booking simple, fast and reliable.  I've even booked restaurants while walking up to the door, noticing a crowd, then breezed right past them to sit down.  Lots of restaurants are on there - hopefully the velocity of new ones is very high - it should be

5 stars, "One of the smoothest easy to use apps out there", by MLAKE1, for version 4.4.1, on Apr 2, 2013
Every app should run like this one.  Easy to search favorites as well as geographically, either by user-entered region or GPS, to find a reservation.  Access to menus and restaurant websites.  Just wish every restaurant paid attention to make mobile-friendly websites and menus.  Able to access profile to see pending reservations as well as past history within the app.  Don't think it's ever crashed in 2 years using it

I use this app a lot: it makes finding local restaurants quick and easy, especially when you don't have the time to wait and need to reserve a table. the user interface is intuitive to a point; when you go to make your reservation and add a special request, it's unclear in the most recent versions, whether the special request has been saved and transmitted. something that could be solved with a save or submit button that's not there anymore.

I've used this app for a few years now and really like the convenience. I've never had a restaurant tell me that they didn't have my reservation on their list, which can happen with other apps. I would like to see more restaurants added though. There seems to be a fairly decent selection in my area, but I know there could be more based on my dining experience in my home town.

Open Table is convenient, easy to use, and reliable.  You don't have to call the restaurant; merely run the app the moment you decide you need a reservation.  Away from home?  No problem:  the app finds what's near you or any cuisine you want.

5 stars, "Open Table opens up the tables", by Michael SCHWARTZ, for version 4.5.0, on Apr 13, 2013
The best app out. Open Table makes dinner reservations a click away. I've made them days in advance, weeks in advance.  Made reservations in cities I'm traveling to and have no idea where to eat. I even made them while standing in a restaurant being told they have no tables for 2 hours and being seated in 30 seconds. Open Table gives you the reviews, menus and directions that would take much longer to search out on the web. Best app winner in my opinion.

Having OT makes it so easy to find availability for a restaurant.

Tip: Sometimes the allocated amount of available OT slots gets filled. So, if OT says there is no availability you may want to call the restaurant directly.

It also gave me a weird message "Drat we couldn't find any restaurants in this area" - I am not joking, I guess "Drat" stays for "Darn"? Wish i could upload the screenshot here. Also search for a specific restaurant cannot find it even if I know for a fact there is this restaurant in the area. I will be deleting the app.

5 stars, "Most efficient way to dine!", by cbody, for version 4.4.1, on Apr 15, 2013
Great app!! I never make reservations without it! The only suggestion I have for improvement is more leniency in the restaurant search. You have to enter the EXACT name of restaurant for it to pull it up. For example "The Capital Grille".. Just "Capital Grille" won't find it...

Doesn't matter what city I'm in, I use open table every time I eat out. Reviews are helpful, but the best part is calling a restaurant, they say they can't get me in, then jump on open table and BOOM! Get a table. I've even done it in the lobby of a restaurant.

4 stars, "The BEST way to make restaurant reservations!", by Astrohorse, for version 4.4.1, on Apr 20, 2013
I use this app a lot and I love it. It has every restaurant I've ever looked for and has introduced me to quite a few new ones. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I travel a lot and getting it to find restaurants in a city you're not currently in is, in my opinion, more difficult than it needs to be. I wish there were a way to just type in the city you're looking for rather than navigating through drop down menus. But it's a minor flaw in an otherwise fantastic app.  Highly recommended!!

4 stars, "Great with one exception", by garrygray, for version 4.5.0, on Apr 21, 2013
The Open Table app works well and is a big help making reservations quickly, as long as the restaurant you want to visit is on their list.  My biggest quibble with the app is its poor search capability.  Many restaurants have names that are strange or hard to spell. If you are one letter off when you want to search, Open Table says, "sorry", not on our list.  Instead, a smarter search function would help you find the restaurant you are looking for.

A great way to find local eateries with customer reviews that appear quite authentic (as opposed to YELP reviews which I understand are sometimes gamed). 

I've never had a reservation made on Open Table not honored and their reward system gets you money off at participating restaurants. 

One of my favorite apps. You can't go wrong.

Via web or mobile app, very reliable, meaning if you make a reservation, it never gets lost!
Only two problems I've ever had:
1 - a few years ago, had trouble modifying a reservation and wound up deleting it. Hope that's been fixed. 
2 - very often, it says no reservations available within two hours of the requested time...but when I call the restaurant they're puzzled because they have tables available! What's up with that??

5 stars, "Beats the heck out of calling around.", by Milverton, for version 4.5.0, on Apr 27, 2013
Great selection of restaurants, nicely organized &amp; very quick &amp; easy to use. Instant reservations based on actual availability. Why waste time calling restaurants only to find they're fully booked at the times you want? 

OpenTable is like having your own inside view to available times at all of your favorite restaurants as well as providing a great guide to explore new choices too. 

Only enhancement suggestions include: 
1. Provide ability to enter a zip code versus having to choose only Current Location or from a long scroll list. 
2. While the featured suggestions on the home page are very useful, it is frustrating as heck that once you click on one of the listed restaurants the whole list changes &amp; you can't simply go back to click on others that caught your eye on the initial list. This is an added bonus feature not core functionality but is very frustrating indeed that if you choose to use it, it does not function as you would expect. Allow users to prompt for new suggestions, don't remove the ones you already provided just because we happened to look at one of those. 

Otherwise, fantastic app that I use all the time. I never call restaurants to check availability or make reservations any more, this is so quick, easy &amp; user friendly. Oh, and reliable too - never had any issues with the reservation not being in place.

The latest app update seems to have lost the ability to filter by vicinity; filter by neighborhood doesn't seem to limit the list. I just can't use 235 restaurant suggestions. Worse, when I specified a restaurant by name, nothing happened!

4 stars, "Works great, please add more restaurants!", by Christoph '-D, for version 4.5.0, on May 3, 2013
I've used this for most of my favorite restaurants and have found some new ones when the one I was looking for wasn't on the list. The restaurants are informed of my food allergy beforehand and everything is ready when I arrive. 
Love it, it just needs more restaurant choices.

I think this is a terrific app. Almost all of the restaurants I frequent take advantage of Open Table. All my contact information is stored so it takes very few keystrokes to make a reservation. Canceling or changing a reservation is very easy. And getting points for each reservation is a really nice bonus! I never ever want to call a restaurant for a reservation again.

This is an easy to use and convenient app for making restaurant reservations. I also like its suggestions. But it gets four stars because far too often my attempts to make special requests don't appear to be heard by the restaurants - whereas a phone call for a reservation and special request always gets it done in comparison. But for run of the mill reservations it works great.

3 stars, "Why reserve when I can order ahead with appay?", by 1coolman, for version 4.5.0, on May 6, 2013
It's a fine app. But appay can order now, takeout, preorder and even refills too. Plus, appay isn't just limited to restaurants and has augmented reality, a visual stumbler, memberships, qr codes, and coupons that automatically attach themselves. I mean seriously...
--
2 stars, "Agree with 1coolman", by henryhby63, for version 4.5.0, on May 6, 2013
appay orders, open table doesn't. Instead of waiting for an hour for my food, I can order ahead and sit there and chat for half the time or less. Plain and simple. The refill support in appay alone is enough.

The only issue I've ever had, is restaurants and not paying attention to special requests (ie birthdays etc). If we have a special occasion, and I've put it in the requests section, I still always double check that the restaurant read the request. That isn't OpenTable's fault however. Get this app if you eat out a lot.

If your target restaurant participates, and most do, this is essential.  And the points ultimately pay off with a nice splurge. When I get that $100 certain ate, we have the greatest wine!

Open Table is great. I have only one criticism: on the iPhone and iPad, it is nearly impossible to "get to" anything other than major metro areas. I live in York PA. There are plenty of Open Table restaurants in Central Pa. But it's not listed on locations and you cannot type it in anywhere.

Working in the food service industry makes planning to go out to eat difficult to schedule. This app is great because you can modify your search based on only on your time frame and size of your party so you can see all the restaurants who have a table available, city wide (if they use this system). This is a great tool that makes the awkward phone calls to random restaurants, while you hope and pray they have something available because you waited to long a thing of the past.

I've used Open Table all over the country--L.A., Boston, Pittsburgh, NYC, Saratoga Springs, Rochester, Minn-St Paul, Madison, Wisc..... &amp; hometown Chicago &amp; environs for years.  Not ALL good restaurants are represented, but I've never gone wrong with places voted "neighborhood gems," "fit for foodies" etc, by the food-erati who faithfully report on their experiences--from finicky nitpickers whom nothing pleases to those who write only glowing reviews, to others who offer a bite-by-bite rendition of each meal consumed by each member of their party. It's a fun way to navigate the food circus in &amp; around cities. Our family's become spoiled--no more dining disasters! Thank you, Open Table--We'd be lost without you!I

4 stars, "Very good, but...", by ggruber66, for version 4.5.0, on May 12, 2013
For one the search should always default to "nearby" rather than the location of the last search. 

Also it would be better to have filters by region or ability to select multiple cities rather than individual cities one at a time (for suburban choices).

4 stars, "Very convenient.", by bchegh, for version 4.5.0, on May 12, 2013
Like to read reviews, see menus and make reservations. It would be nice if it were possible to amend reservation with a special request AFTER reservation already made (instead of having to phone the restaurant).
That being said, I am more efficient making reservations in opentable than calling individual restaurants. Thanks for the app.

Find the App easy to use, but some of the restaurants we frequent do not have many or any reservations when we want to eat there.

Only use the App when we have decided to eat at a certain restaurant and that may be within less than an hour of when we want it.

Do not see this as a problem with Open Table, but with being able to establish relationships with our favorite restaurants.

What a joy it is to look for restaurants, read reviews, make reservations...in town and when on the road, and all without waiting on hold or dealing with an automated phone system at the various restaurants! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this app...it's a breeze to use and ever so helpful...I'm hooked 👏 Recently, while in NYC, the hubby and I researched and made a reservation for dinner as we walked back to the area of our hotel; found a terrific vegan place and made a res on OT; we got sidetracked with window-gazing, so we quickly just adjusted the reservation time via the OT app...and they had our table waiting when we walked in...thank you to OpenTable! 😘 FANTASTIC app 👍

Love the ability to find places, but recently was forced to make an uncomfortably early reservation (OpenTable indicated no availability at the desired time) and the place was fairly empty we got there and stayed that way. So if OpenTable doesn't allow you to make a reservation during the time desired, try just calling the restaurant and seeing if they can accommodate you.

A bit frustrating this time--couldn't write in Sausalito, only option was SF Bay Area. Maybe I could have filtered after selecting, but instead found restaurant name on Internet &amp; plugged it in to make reservation.

5 stars, "Great app for reservations", by Smargo3, for version 4.5.0, on May 16, 2013
This is a great app if you need to make reservations and are always on the go. It's fast, easy and I have always had my reservation honored by the restaurant. None of that, " Oh sorry, we don't seem to have you on our list". We had that happen once and when we told them we had used Open Table and had the print copy of the confirmation in the car, our reservation suddenly materialized. Gives a broad spectrum of choices and the points are a plus. Definitely one of my go to apps.

2 stars, "No Name search?  No Cuisine type?", by DaveBarr, for version 1.0.1, on Nov 21, 2008
I'm reading all these other reviews and I can't help but think there's some astroturffing going on.

All you can do is search for 20 closest restaurants to you.  That's pretty much it!  Come on folks, I know it's only 1.0, but this sort of functionality was written by one schmuck in his basement a couple months after the iPhone came out.  Its now well over a year later and all you give us is _this_?  And it still crashed for me a minute after my first use.

5 stars, "GREAT MUST HAVE!  ONE REQUEST", by Patronus, for version 1.0.1, on Nov 21, 2008
Please add the ability to enter the name of a specific restaurant.  I'm totally confused why that feature wasn't part of the application to begin with.  Get Yelp and OpenTable.  The two provide are a great combination.

2 stars, "Huh?", by TenFist, for version 1.0.1, on Nov 25, 2008

1 star, "More Locations", by Jelvis Chan, for version 1.1, on Feb 14, 2009
This app would work well if they had a worldwide update.

They need to have all cities in Europe--
Germany, France, Italy, and Austria at least.

1 star, "Horrible!", by El Pisso TX, for version 1.1.1, on Feb 19, 2009
Ok, El Paso TX isnt the most important or popular city in the U.S. but only two resturants are available in my entire city of almost 1 million people. Come on!

3 stars, "Still missing a few minor details . . . .", by W. Hawkins, for version 3.0.2, on Mar 29, 2010
Wait, before you purchase!  You have to sign in every time you use the app, there is no way for you to make "YOUR NOTES" of your personal review of the establishment, and Lord only knows who these people are giving their opinions that get attached to the site, but the user should have a small area that they can make their own personal notes, so they can remember their personal views, and experiences with service and food, and the noise level.  After all, exactly who will be eating and from which pocket will the money come from - - the next time a reservation is made?  And, you cannot add to or change your "profile", e.g., low noise level only, four stars or more only, or, any other such criteria.  Perhaps OpenTable, Inc. does not use (rely on) their app.

5 stars, "Love the updated OpenTable! ", by LITL DVL, for version 3.0.2, on May 24, 2010
Wow. The updates to the OpenTable app are much-needed and much-appreciated! 

I like the parking details and ability to search by restaurant name. A photo or restaurant logo is a nice touch, too. 

By the way, I now have over 24K points with OpenTable. 
--------------

I've been using OpenTable since at least 2006 and I've accumulated over 22,000 OpenTable points. The iPhone app for this online reservation service is amazing.  

Granted there were hiccups along the way, but OpenTable continues to listen to its customers' feedback -- and incorporates into future app updates. The most recent update includes menu viewing from within the app, 1,000-point reservations, AND the ability to sign up as new user! 

OpenTable customer service has been stellar. I've had a few questions over the years, not relating to the iPhone app, and my questions have been answered promptly and professionally.  

If you're not already using this app and/or the OpenTable service, I highly recommend that you start now. 

3 stars, "Good but missing some simple things", by Eloraz_78, for version 2.0, on Sep 7, 2009
Unless you book a restaurant, you can't see directions to it. You can just see a map. Also, can't search around a zip unless you are already there and search for current location. I really wish I could search around a zip code before I get there. Last thing..when I log into my account, I get asked if I want the program to remember my password. I click yes, but neither user name nor password is remembered and I have to type them each time 

Other than that cool app and awesome service. I use it all the time!

1 star, "Say No to Ads", by 82765, for version 3.3.1, on Oct 7, 2011
I'm passing on this update and deleting the app. 

1) The previous version functioned well but was missing a lot compared to the web site. 

2) Ads for restaurants in a location one is searching are annoying but at least relevant. Cars? Not so much. C-ya!
