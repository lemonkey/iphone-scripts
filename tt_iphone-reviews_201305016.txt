4 stars, "Great little App", by Doug1Mac, for version 3.9, on 10-Oct-2012
Great little App for booking restaurant tables.
Very easy to search. Very easy to book.
Just needs more restaurants to join to make it 5*

1 star, "Old version much better - don't delete it!", by Patrick-089458843, for version 3.9, on 10-Oct-2012
There's no way to search based on a location (other than using their hard coded list). The old version lets you specify a location like Covent Garden or Soho (both of which have loads of restaurants) -- instead you have to search all of central London. Is also rubbish map wise as will only display 20 restaurants on the map. The search based on filters is also poorer. Never mind, I'll book with the restaurants directly as they all give the same offers if you ask.

1 star, "This was great - but not any more", by DavidWww, for version 3.9, on 14-Oct-2012
The TopTable app seems to have been replaced by a rebranded version of the horrible OpenTable service which, as another reviewer has noted, has very poor search facilities. Confirmation by text message has disappeared too.  It doesn't seem to have crossed the minds of the owners of OpenTable that their service never really caught on in the UK, and so introducing it again under the name of a much more successful service might not be the greatest of ideas. It would have been better to have stuck with something that worked. I for one will not be using TopTable again as I can't be bothered to search out restaurants from long lists with poor filters.

1 star, "What happened?!", by Bobbbbbbbbbbbyaaaa, for version 3.9, on 25-Oct-2012
Last time I used Toptable it came up with a decent selection of places. Now it seems to have a tiny and pointless selection and limited offers.

4 stars, "Thumbs up", by elksta, for version 3.9, on 26-Oct-2012
A very useful and easy to use app, although some of the given areas are a bit too broad when looking up possible restaurants.
--
4 stars, "Pretty good", by CaptainJD, for version 3.9, on 27-Oct-2012
I used Open Table loads while travelling.  Once you get used to it, this app is great. Never used Top Table app, so I don't claim to make comparisons.  Hopefully they will take the best from top table app too :-)

1 star, "Rubbish", by !!!!!!!!!!!,!,!!!",!, for version 3.9, on 28-Oct-2012
This app is rubbish it keeps crashing!

5 stars, "Great app", by Adu1239, for version 3.9, on 02-Nov-2012
Booked a table in under 3 mins, what more can you ask for. Shows you where the place is on google maps and you can even change your booking in the app. The menu is also in the app and once your happy it will load it onto your colander for you.

3 stars, "Can't sort by cuisine", by MW9427, for version 3.9, on 03-Nov-2012
Great app which is spoilt by not being able to sort by cuisine within a geographic area

5 stars, "Speedy", by Tezza100, for version 3.9, on 05-Nov-2012
Easy to use and much quicker than using the phone.

5 stars, "Really intuitive", by Boroughboy, for version 3.9, on 06-Nov-2012
Great app, much better than the iPhone one which was pretty useless and always pulled out random restaurants in Liverpool (I live in London!).
--
5 stars, "A fantastic inmprovement", by Bricklane, for version 3.9, on 10-Nov-2012
This version of the App is great, easier to use than the main website, and a fantastic improvement to the last one whether on iPad or iPhone.  Only one thing - there's now no option at all, it would seem, to search by postcode, and that's a shame.
--
5 stars, "Works very well", by michaeljavis, for version 3.9, on 13-Nov-2012
The are a couple of minor irritations, I couldn't easily clear the search filter, had to start a new search for instance, but on the whole a great app

2 stars, "Not very useful in the UK", by Annatomik, for version 4.1, on 01-Dec-2012
Maybe for some on London but most major cities return little or no places of interest. Stick to Trip Advisor to find a place and then use the dog and bone...
--
5 stars, "Great help", by Mrs Mallard, for version 4.1, on 06-Dec-2012
Wonderful to use!  Once I found my way around, it was nice to have confidence my booking was made. So much less hassle than calling the restaurant. Well done.
--
4 stars, "Great app", by Hammo, for version 4.1, on 07-Dec-2012
Excellent - incredibly useful and easy to use. All restaurants should be forced to sign up - life would be so easy!
--
5 stars, "Handy", by Lotsw, for version 4.1, on 12-Dec-2012
The app is handy as it allows me to book tables quickly &amp; so far, the accuracy of the data in terms of booking experience has been 100%. It works, it saves time, I'm happy!

5 stars, "Toptable - Top trumps!", by Fiery Freddy is ready, for version 4.1, on 16-Dec-2012
Very easy to use this app. Makes restaurant selection and booking a breeze.
--
1 star, "Downgrade", by berny90, for version 4.1, on 18-Dec-2012
This version feels like a huge downgrade coming from the previous toptable app, both in the feel, design and usability - I'm still going to use the previous version, despite the warnings to switch to the new app.
--
5 stars, "Great app", by Rangey63, for version 4.1, on 27-Dec-2012
Really useful app that makes booking and cancelling a breeze. Latest update gives you access to your bookings through the app which is very handy. Use this app all the time for city centre restaurant bookings and have always found it 100% reliable.

5 stars, "Great for planning your night out!", by mcf0451, for version 4.1, on 05-Jan-2013
Brilliant range of restaurants and good selection of offers make this a standard feature of our meal planning.
--
2 stars, "Good Idea but limited uptake?", by Bazro, for version 4.1, on 05-Jan-2013
Seemed a great idea, but the locator did not work (yes I followed instructions) and unless you are in London you may not be eating out tonight. Needs more restaurants to sign up I suspect?
--
4 stars, "Toptable", by Clive Kornitzer, for version 4.1, on 06-Jan-2013
First port of call as long as the restaurant is on the list it works brilliantly use it all the time.

Good app, just wish you could browse restaurants by cuisine/location

5 stars, "Fantastic App", by dmo88, for version 4.1, on 08-Jan-2013
As far as free apps go this one is brilliant. Very thorough, well designed and laid out, informative and quick. Highly recommend it if you eat out and enjoy finding new places to eat,  never let me down so far and I've used it regularly for the last 18months. 5 stars and well deserved.

5 stars, "Ronseal", by Paul12001, for version 4.1, on 09-Jan-2013
To quote Cameron 
It does what it says on the tin
Could do with more restaurants signing up but I would think that will come

2 stars, "Mediocre", by Mrockowski, for version 4.2, on 12-Jan-2013
Not as good as opentable. Very difficult to navigate location, odd way of categorizing neighborhoods.
--
5 stars, "Faster than using the phone", by Mini war, for version 4.2, on 15-Jan-2013
Great app with very good coverage of restaurants in London.  Booking tables via Toptable is faster &amp; more convenient than by phone!  Be aware the some restaurants don't release all their tables to Toptable so call if no availability appears on this app.

2 stars, "Can't change date/time easily", by Valiant65, for version 4.2, on 25-Jan-2013
Good at finding restaurants but once you've searched availability in a restaurant you can't change date or time without starting over - very frustrating.
--
2 stars, "A bit clumsy", by inq, for version 4.2, on 29-Jan-2013
Very irritating that the only way to try different date and/or time is to start the search over again.
--
2 stars, "Unintuitive interface", by Dark Beaver, for version 4.2, on 30-Jan-2013
When searching by name, it is not obvious that the restaurants will be displayed below. I had previously selected an area in London which happened to not be quite correct so when I entered the name of the restaurant the app appeared to do nothing.

When using the iPad in landscape, there is very little vertical room for the reviews etc of a restaurant but they get enlarged horizontally which means you can barely fit one review on.

Worst of all, and as mentioned in other reviews, once you have selected a restaurant you cannot go back and change the date or time without starting a new search again.

I think if these couple of things are fixed then it should be a perfectly good app, but for now might as well use the website.
--
4 stars, "Not a bad app", by Captain746657, for version 4.2, on 31-Jan-2013
Does whats it's supposed to do.

However, I'd like to be able to change the date I've selected without having to go through the whole search process from scratch, and also have the full details (times) of special offers, like at the website.
--
5 stars, "Useful App", by Ajiolu, for version 4.2, on 03-Feb-2013
I use this app not only to book tables but to learn about new restaurants. The reviews and descriptions are useful, I get to know in advance if I can park. It's a very useful app.

5 stars, "Brilliant", by katyp, for version 4.2, on 06-Feb-2013
Love it.

4 stars, "Very useful", by Woodstock17, for version 4.2, on 09-Feb-2013
I use this app a lot, mainly for London, where I live, however have also used on foreign trips, when it is really helpful, if in a new city.  Sometimes it seems a bit difficult to navigate, and obviously one is annoyed when some restaurants have not signed up...  But overall incredibly useful.
--
5 stars, "Top table", by janeayl, for version 4.2, on 12-Feb-2013
Love it - have found some lovely restaurants near home that I would not have found without this app. Very easy to use.

5 stars, "Great app", by ohcomeon-why, for version 4.2, on 09-Mar-2013
This is a great app for finding and booking restaurants in next to no time. We have found some real gems close to us that we didn't even know existed.

5 stars, "A great help,", by Gaff66, for version 4.4.1, on 16-Mar-2013
This site is a great help when we are in big cities, and we have not had any issues with the booking or the restaurants of our choice. Great site!!
--
3 stars, "Works well with a few annoyances", by someone_somewhere_1, for version 4.4.1, on 25-Mar-2013
Easy to use (although being able to free type location would be more intuitive), imported my number with a decimal place and didn't like it, so I had to modify the number. Needs a little work but looks good so far.
--
5 stars, "Invaluable for wining and dining for family or business...", by Torryn, for version 4.4.1, on 25-Mar-2013
Really useful and cannot believe how efficient when you need somewhere at short notice. As usual for planning the kids or customers.

1 star, "Used to be Fantastic", by Cab Rider, for version 4.4.1, on 28-Mar-2013
Used to be fantastic but restaurants no longer appear based on location rendering it useless. :(
--
1 star, "App Doesn't Work", by Scorchio28, for version 4.4.1, on 01-Apr-2013
The app doesn't show restaurants by location or available times. Only can access the information on the website so App is useless
--
1 star, "Oh dear", by dtw194, for version 4.4.1, on 01-Apr-2013
Oh dear seems like the most recent update has rendered the app now pretty useless as there seem to be lots of problems in the search function ie it no longer works such a shame
--
3 stars, "Pauline", by SARPLF, for version 4.4.1, on 03-Apr-2013
Too soon to say how well this app works. I knew the restaurant I wanted to book and the process was quite quick, but it would have been helpful to have more areas of London - I wanted Mayfair.
--
2 stars, "Clunky app", by Isollabella, for version 4.4.1, on 16-Apr-2013
Previous one much easier

Originally couldn't get current location to work. Now it does

Tried to put in special request but then the confirm booking sign vanished
